if
you
ask
group
of
six
year
olds
what
they
want
to
be
when
they
grow
up
theres
good
chance
most
of
them
will
say
athlete
in
reality
the
vast
majority
of
those
kids
will
wind
up
doing
something
else
but
havana
mcelvaine
was
determined
to
beat
the
odds
it
started
when
she
joined
the
local
rec
soccer
team
the
pink
flamingos
because
all
her
friends
had
they
kicked
the
ball
around
the
park
every
weekend
playing
until
the
golden
summer
sun
dipped
below
the
horizon
loved
it
says
the
denver
native
soon
the
game
turned
into
more
than
hobby
it
was
her
life
by
the
time
was
13
or
14
said
ok
im
really
going
to
do
this
she
says
by
15
she
was
getting
calls
from
the
university
of
washington
the
uw
was
one
of
the
first
universities
that
recruited
mcelvaine
who
earned
her
bachelors
in
sociology
in
remember
sitting
in
coach
gallimores
office
when
was
junior
in
high
school
and
hearing
her
offer
me
scholarship
she
says
my
mom
and
just
looked
at
each
other
like
what
thats
huge
someone
cared
enough
about
me
doing
something
loved
that
they
were
willing
to
support
it
so
could
do
it
without
any
financial
burden
and
thats
massive
privilege
for
mcelvaine
soccer
not
school
had
always
been
her
sole
identity
when
she
became

all
changed

south
central
los

the
first
time
saw
myself
as
someone
who
could
be
good
at
soccer
and
scholarly
was
when
got
to
the
uw
says
mcelvaine
four
year
defender
for
the
huskies
the
culture
of
my
team
and
of
the
entire
athletic
department
is
that
its
cool
and
important
to
do
well
in
school
my
athletic
experience
was
only
as
valuable
as
how
supplemented
it
with
my
academics
and
vice
versa
as
an
incoming
freshman
mcelvaine
wasnt
set
on
major
she
knew
she
liked
talking
about
race
and
equity
and
social
justice
but
when
she
enrolled
in
professor
alexes
harris
course
race
and
ethnicity
in
the
united
states
she
discovered
that
not
only
could
she
study
these
topics
that
were
so
personal
to
her
but
there
were
other
women
of
color
already
doing
it
that
was
the
first
time
id
ever
had
professor
who
looked
like
me
and
that
was
transformative
she
says
her
class
is
what
sparked
my
interest
in
sociology
and
looking
at
these
problems
in
really
scientific
pragmatic
critical
way
ldquo
havana
is
committed
to
and
passionate
about
justice
shes
one
of
those
students
think
most
professors
wish
they
had
in
their
class
she
makes
you
think
about
the
question
you
just
asked
and
think
about
it
differently

23
minutes
before
the

team
kicked
off

opener
mcelvaine
dropped
bare
knee
on
the
damp
playing
field
of
husky
soccer
stadium
as
the
star
spangled
banner
rang
through
the
loudspeakers
the
moment
was
inspired
by
san

ers
then
quarterback
colin
kaepernick
who
had
opted
one
month
earlier
not
to
stand
during
the
pregame
national
anthem
instead
he
sat
on
the
bench
arms
crossed
it
was
quiet
response
to
polarizing
issue
police
brutality
against
people
of
color
movement
took
hold
as
athletes
across
the
country
sat
kneeled
raised
fists
and
linked
arms
for
their
own
causes
sparking
nationwide
conversation
about
human
rights
the
day
before
she
took
knee
mcelvaine
had
watched
footage
of
the
shooting
of
terence
crutcher
black
man
killed
by
police
officer
in
tulsa
oklahoma
id
seen
bunch
of
videos
before
she
says
but
with
this
one
just
couldnt
get
myself
together
couldnt
control
my
crying
at
practice
mcelvaine
powered
through
her
drills
but
her
coaches
and
teammates
knew
something
was
wrong
the
next
day
before
the
national
anthem
coach
gallimore
looked
at
me
and
said
havana
if
you
want
to
kneel
you
can
recalls
mcelvaine
hadnt
even
thought
about
kneeling
but
in
that
moment
she
really
knew
me
better
than
knew
myself
she
enabled
me
to
be
in
solidarity
with
movement
cared
about
and
that
was
really
powerful
for
me
ldquo
havanas
journey
to
figure
out
who
she
was
and
what
she
stood
for
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
examples
of
soul
searching
ive
witnessed
in
young
person

havana
mcelvaine
is
one
of
countless
student
athletes
with
big
dreams
on
the
field
and
off
but
many
cannot
afford
to
pursue
them
you
can
help
these
students
get
the
edge
they
need
in

in

in

major
priority
supported
by
the
uws
race
amp
equity
initiative
the
movement
for
racial
equity
and
social
justice
was
also
top
of
mind
for
mcelvaines
teammates
and
other
student
athletes
it
became
apparent
that
we
needed
to
initiate
these
uncomfortable
conversations
and
build
community
around
these
topics
she
says
so
her
team
created
new
culture
where
they
opened
up
the
floor
and
talked
about
everything
looping
in
coaches
administrators
and
academic
advisers
it
was
this
really
poignant
time
for
all
of
us
to
be
student
athletes
and
to
have
this
platform
and
this
space
to
talk
says
mcelvaine
who
stepped
into
leadership
role
as
senior
and
team
captain
but
the
poignancy
ran
even
deeper
for
mcelvaine
in
her
21
years
shed
always
seen
her
identities
as
separate
on
the
field
she
was
soccer
player
in
the
classroom
student
in
her
community
champion
for
change
now
she
was
everything
at
once
during
her
four
years
at
the
uw
mcelvaine
learned
about
education
and
policy
reform
and
public
housing
she
helped
professor
track
how
childrens
perceptions
of
race
and
identity
change
over
time
then
for
her
senior
honors
thesis
she
created
her
own
research
project
analyzing
the
impact
that
repeated
video
exposure
to
police
violence
and
shootings
has
on
black
male
college
students
in
series
of
focus
groups
with
black
men
on
campus
mcelvaine
asked
them
what
it
meant
to
see
these
incredibly
violent
incidents
happening
in
real
time
over
and
over
again
the
conversations
were
heavy
says
mcelvaine
but
so
important
ldquo
think
to
create
connection
healing
and
togetherness
you
need
an
ability
to
empathize
with
people
who
are
different

you

it
wasnt
until
she
attended
the

in

that
mcelvaine
realized
she
didnt
have
deep
rooted
knowledge
of
the
history
of
racial
identity
despite
spending
every
day
talking
and
thinking
about
it
there
was
this
huge
disconnect
she
says
have
this
really
narrow
understanding
of
black
history
not
only
in
the
but
globally
the
history
of
where
came
from
and
why
im
here
understanding

became
the
inspiration
for
her

to
answer
questions
like

my
experience
here

specific
to
america
is
it
specific
to
me
is
it
universal
experience
how
do
black
women
around
the
world
think
about
race
and
equity
and
how
those
things
interact
with
gender
and
activism
and
social
justice
then
she
hopes
to
bring
what
shes
learned
back
home
im
most
excited
to
see
how
