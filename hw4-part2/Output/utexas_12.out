how

way
oral

such

is
effective
only

whom
the
notification
was
given
for
example
if
you
give
oral
notification
to
group
of

on
the
first
day
of

and
student
was
not
present
because
he
or

difficult
clearly
communicate
to

the

for
example
some
active
dance
classes
require
the
free
movement
and
physical
interaction
that
could
inadvertently
reveal
someone
who
is
trying
to

encourage
your
students
who

to
carry
and
choose
to
carry
handgun
to
think
through

day
and
plan
accordingly
which
may
mean
leaving
their
handgun
at

in

you
are
the
only
faculty
member
assigned
to

may
you
ban
concealed
carry
in
your
office
by
oral
notification
this
is
the
only
legally
effective
way
to
do
so
you
may
orally
notify
students
in
your
class
or
learning
environment
in
variety
of
ways
for
example
you
can
make
an
announcement
on
the
first
day
of
class
if
any
students
are
not
present
for
that
class
or
if
you
have
students
who
join
the
class
later
you
must
provide
the
same
notice
to
them
given
the
movement
of
students
in
and
out
of
classes
during
the
first
few
weeks
you
may
wish
to
have
your
students
sign
statement
that
acknowledges
that
they
have
received
oral
notification
of
your
desire
to
ban
guns
in
your
office
we
realize
each
class
and
faculty
member
presents
different
situation
so
implement
oral
notification
in
the
way
that
works
best
for
you
if
you
are
having
trouble
deciding
how
to
best
implement
in
legally
effective
way
we
encourage
you
to
contact
the
implementation
task
force
to
receive
guidance
what
is
oral
notice
how
is
it
defined
oral
notice
is
spoken
communication
that
makes
clear
to
the
listener
that
concealed
carry
of
handguns
is
not
permitted
in
that
faculty
member
office
no
particular
words
are
required
it
can
be
as
simple
as
prohibit
the
concealed
carry
of
handguns
in
my
office
can
put
sign
on
my
office
door
signs
are
not
legally
effective
way
to
provide
notice
that
you
have

office
if

we
remind
you
that
oral

is
the
only
legally
effective
way
to
provide
that
notice
sign
not
accompanied
by
oral
notification
might
be
considered
wrongful
exclusion
and
thus
violation
of
the
law
subject
to
fines
and
penalties
associated
with
the
law
you
are
not
authorized
however
to
put
up
sign
the
statutorily
required
sign
that

notice
to

that
the

personnel
are

information
about

you
may
however
please
remember
that
notification
