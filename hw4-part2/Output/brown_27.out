brown
initiative
for
computation
in
brain
and

br
computational
methods
have
been
enormously
productive
for
understanding
complexities
inherent
in
natural
systems
from
the
weather
to
aerodynamics
physics
and
biology
the
brain
is
perhaps
the
most
complex
and
interesting
of
these
systems
the
problem
of
understanding
the
relationship
between
brain
and
mind
is
so
immensely
complex
that
close
interaction
among
theorists
and
experimentalists
is
required
to
gain
deeper
understanding
of
fundamental
brain
and
cognitive
processes
because
of
the
many
levels
spanning
from
molecules
to
cognition
multiple
levels
of
computer
simulations
from
those
focused
on
details
of
neuronal
function
to
those
focused
on
the
abstract
computations
that
emerge
from
these
networks
can
be
fruitfully
applied
to
bridge
this
gap
brown

computation
in
brain

is
place
where
these
types
of
