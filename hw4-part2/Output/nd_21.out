the
boston
massacre
trial
re
enactment
when
regiment
of
british
soldiers
was
accused
of
murdering
five
colonists
in
the
boston
massacre
of
the
attorneys
who
saved
the
soldiers
rsquo
lives
at
trial
were
staunch
american
patriots
it
was
not
an
easy
decision
to
advocate
for
the
enemy
josiah
quincy
jr
rsquo
father
wrote
in
letter
few
weeks
after
the
massacre
ldquo
am
under
great
affliction
at
hearing
the
bitterest
reproaches
uttered
against
you
for
having
become
an
advocate
for
those
criminals
who
are
charged
with
the
murder
of
their
fellow
citizens
good
god
is
it
possible
rdquo
today
historians
see
the
trial
as
an
early
test
of
the
colonies
rsquo
legal
system
laying
the
foundation
for
the
united
states
as
nation
ruled
by
laws
rather
than
the
arbitrary
decisions
of
people
in
power
quincy
replied
that
he
was
convinced
to
defend
the
british
by
no
less
than
his
co
counsel
john
adams
founding
father
and
future
president
of
the
new
nation
adams
worried
that
an
unfair
trial
would
do
serious
long
term
damage
to
the
patriots
rsquo
cause
he
later
wrote
that
defending
the
soldiers
was
ldquo
one
of
the
best
pieces
of
service
ever
rendered
my
country
rdquo
ldquo
judgment
of
death
against
those
soldiers
rdquo
he
wrote
ldquo
would
have
been
as
foul
stain
upon
this
country
as
the
executions
of
the
quakers
or
witches
anciently
rdquo
ironically
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
that
trial
charged
with
finding
the
british
soldiers
guilty
was
british
official
and
loyalist
to
the
king
today

even
when

howard
delivered
his
argument
in

competition
with

in

the

it
also
includes

blakey

declined
to

ldquo
because
the
rule

but
he
said
the
triumph
of

over

is
something
that

that

must
earn
through

bellia
notre

law
professor
introduced
the
re
enactment
with
presentation
on
the
history
and
context
of
the
boston
massacre
and
trial
the
incident
started
with
misunderstanding
over
man
rsquo
honor
wigmaker
rsquo
apprentice
accused
british
officer
of
not
paying
his
bill
taunting
sentry
outside
the
customs
house
on
what
is
now
known
as
state
street
it
was
later
discovered
that
the
bill
had
been
settled
the
previous
day
the
sentry
responded
by
striking
the
young
man
with
his
musket
drawing
crowd
of
other
colonists
to
the
scene
bellia
said
colonial
resentment
of
british
presence
had
been
growing
in
boston
since
the
soldiers
were
stationed
there
two
years
earlier
to
enforce
the
townshend
acts
which
included
revenue
taxes
on
items
such
as
wine
paper
and
glass
at
first
no
one
wanted
to
represent
the
soldiers
bellia
said
until
john
adams
risked
his
law
practice
for
his
belief
that
everyone
deserves
fair
trial
more
british
soldiers
arrived
at
the
scene
to
protect
the
sentry
and
the
crowd
attacked
the
regiment
with
snowballs
rocks
and
coal
there
are
conflicting
accounts
of
how
the
firing
started
but
five
colonists
ended
up
dead
including
crispus
attucks
an
african
american
british
gov
thomas
hutchinson
finally
dispersed
the
crowd
by
promising
full
inquiry
into
the
incident
at
first
no
one
wanted
to
represent
the
soldiers
bellia
said
until
john
adams
risked
his
law
practice
for
his
belief
that
everyone
deserves
fair
trial
the
jury
was
asked
to
determine
if
the
soldiers
fired
in
self
defense
the
regiment
rsquo
captain
and
six
others
were
acquitted
and
two
soldiers
were
found
guilty
of
manslaughter
their
lives
were
spared
but
an
ldquo

was
branded

paul

john

and
organized
annual
commemorations
of
the
event
to
whip
up
resentment
of
king
george
iii
and
british
rule
the
boston
massacre
is
considered
the
first
match
that
later
exploded
into
the
american
revolution
yet
john
adams
saw
the
trial
as
an
important
test
of
the
rule
of
law
ldquo
even
in
politically
volatile
situation
the
law
still
prevailed
rdquo
bellia
said
in
contrast
the
aristocracy
in
many
european
societies
at
that
time
could
easily
use
their
power
to
subvert
the
law
bellia
said
unique
aspect
of
notre
dame
rsquo
law
school
is
its
focus
on
constitutional
structure
mdash
the
role
power
and
limits
of
government
mdash
to
ensure
that
laws
are
enforced
in
practice
ldquo
some
places
have
laws
but
they
rsquo
re
not
worth
the
paper
they
rsquo
re
written
on
rdquo
he
said
ldquo
we
talk
lot
about
constitutional
rights
but
rights
are
meaningless
unless
you
have
structure
of
government
to
enforce
them
