wireless

safer
solution
his
project
funded
by
the
national
science
foundation
is
testing
the
idea
of
replacing
the
single
transmitter
used
in
today
rsquo
cell
phones
with
multiple
transmitters
at
different
points
within
the
device
cell
phone
design
generally
uses
single
transmitter
he
said
which
creates
lsquo
hot
spot
rsquo
of
radiation
where
the
antenna
and
amplifier
are
located
by
using
multiple
transmitters
the
project
aims
to
disperse
the
radiation
and
reduce
sar
the
multiple
transmitters
must
be
used
properly
to
both
improve
performance
as
wireless
communication
device
and
to
simultaneously
reduce
sar
early
results
for
this
new
hardware
structure
show
great
promise
hochwald
said

rdquo
while
the
current
generation
of

comply
with
sar
limits
hochwald
said
newer
phones
with
more
features
are
constantly
pushing
toward
the
edge
some
manufacturers
have
already
had
to
artificially
lower
phone
performance
to
meet
sar
requirements
and
the
next
generations
of
phones
including
eventually
5
phones
at
higher
frequencies
will
absolutely
have
to
find
creative
ways
to
limit
human
exposure
to
electromagnetic
radiation
to
reach
their
full
potential
ldquo
the
hope
is
that
we
understand
how
to
incorporate
multiple
high
performance
transmitters
and
also
help
reduce
human
exposure
to
electromagnetic
radiation
