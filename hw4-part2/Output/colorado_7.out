the

so
thats
four

in

crucially
brought

them
their

despite
lucrative
contracts
in

aerospaces
early
days
innovation
was
expensive
and
the
nascent

faltered
in
they
brought
in
ruel
merc
mercure
to
help
write

next
chapter
mercure
had
gotten
his
phd
in

at

boulder
and
had
designed
the
instrument
that
photographed
the

atop

years
later
mercure
told
the
denver
post
what
it
was
like
in

early
days
of

and
ultimately
the
space
business
it
was
great
great
great
great

he
said
the
word
today
is
passionthats
probably
good
way
to
describe
all
of
us
that
were
involved
at
the
timenobody
had
done
these
things
before
aerospace
was
very
very
new
mercure
wrote
in
his
cu
dissertation
that
space
was
an
area
of
scientific
endeavor
in
which
the
smallest
success
brings
with
it
great
personal
sense
of
achievement
and
pleasure
nevertheless
it
was
giant
leaps
that
lay
ahead

positions
director
of

new

office
at
the
time
the
government
had
recently
begun
to
grant
ownership
of
inventions
back
to
the
universities
that
had
created
them
with
federal
funding
which
enabled
the
field
of

transfer
to
better
connect
academic
innovation
with
the
mainstream
economyboosting
economic
development
in
the
process
dubbed
the

the

which
cu
soon
did
lefkoff
worked
on

with
mercure
from

and
helped
cu
design
the
tech
transfer
program
based
on
what
was
best
practice
among
the
best
universities
at
the
time
he
said
we
let
the
professors
know
that
when
you
invent
something
at
cu
if
you
have
the
human
capital
to
make
that
happen
theres
no
institutional
barrier
that
was
an
epiphany
for
many
of
them
mercure
parted
that
sea
of
institutional
resistance
and
created
opportunity
given
his
monumental
success
in
business
it
may
seem
like
an
unusual
move
for
someone
like
mercure
to
return
to
academia
but
not
to
those
who
knew
him
think
it
was
natural
for
him
he
was
probably
at
that
time
one
of
the
only
people
who
knew
how
to
take
university
technology
