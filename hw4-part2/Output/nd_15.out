more
than

to

ldquo
patient

is
about
amplifying

the
patient
understanding
that
the
patient
and
their

are
the
experts

spend

working

patient
medical

handful
of

voluntarily

then
charged
with
compiling

the

creates
summary
that
streamlines
years
of

which
can
be
shared
with
doctors
for
the
students
it
provides
look
at
the
reality
of
living
with

and
the
challenges
of
navigating
cumbersome
health

system
throughout
this
process
students
in
the
course
keep
symptom
list
for

and
develop
better
understanding
of
clinical
language
ldquo
its
really
cool
to
watch
as
the
students
transform
at
first
they
will
ask
you
questions
about
every
technical
word
they
read
but
eventually
they
learn
the
terms
and
begin
using
them
in

rdquo
calhoun
said
ldquo
this
is
so
vital
because
otherwise

chris
patzke
and
the
warren
center
for
drug
discovery
at
that
event
helquist
and
wiest
learned
more
about
the
disease
and
where
research
currently
stood
and
met
afflicted
npc
patients
and
families
its
also
where
they
were
introduced
to
fred
maxfield
professor
at
cornell
university
and
an
expert
in
cell
biology
that
meeting
would
lead
to
decades
long
collaboration
among
the
three
as
they
investigated
npc
and
drug
discovery
for
the
disorder
ldquo
essentially
all
of
the
research
that
had
been
done
at
that
point
was
strictly
biological
to
understand
the
disease
npc
was
originally
this
mystery
disease
but
cindy
thought
there
was
enough
biology
understood
and
that
maybe
some
new
medicinal
chemistry
could
be
started
rdquo
helquist
said
year
later
the
researchers
applied
for
their
first
grant
from
the
fund
over
the
last
20
years
helquist
and
wiest
have
published
numerous
studies
on
the
fundamental
science
behind
npc
supported
by
the
fund
their
research
has
contributed
significantly
to
the
understanding
of
the
npc
1
gene
and
has
been
key
for
identifying
potential
drug
targets
ldquo
its
hard
because
everyone
mdash
parents
caregivers
and
researchers
mdash
wants
cure
now
but
this
kind
of
work
takes
decades
and
with
drug
trials
there
are
going
to
be
lot
more
failures
than
successes

cyclodextrin
is
among
the
drugs
that
they
are
working
to
improve
although
it
has
benefited
npc
patients
there
are
still
some
things
the

cant

well
such
as
crossing

between
the

and
the

that
makes

delivery

notoriously
difficult
current
area
of
interest
for
wiest
helquist
and
maxfield
is
looking
into
new
molecular
transport
mechanism
that
may
better
help
the
drug
get
into
the
brain
while
their
research
continues
cyclodextrin
is
still
being

if

wasnt

would

we
are

rdquo
dreyer
said
ldquo
especially
with

just
want

them
hear
them
and
understand
them
rdquo
courses
required
in
the
minor
such
as
clinical
research
in
rare

provided
dreyer
the
real
world
clinical
experience
that
she
uses
every
day
in
her
role
without
them
she
believes
she
wouldnt
be
as
effective
at
her
job
ldquo
before
started
taking
those
classes
truly
did
not
know
what
clinical
research
was
and
thats
my
job
now
rdquo
dreyer
said
ldquo
learned
so
much
about
what
goes
into
study
what
happens
on
the
fda
side
of
things
how
you
craft
study
what
you
do
during
it
the
data
entry
and
the
natural
history
of
disease
from
notre
dame
rdquo
dreyers
favorite
part
of
the
minor
was
the
courses
that
discussed
precision
medicine
and
the
importance
of
effectively
tending
to
patients
by
tailoring
care
to
them
berry
kravis
shared
how
impressed
shes
been
by
dreyers
commitment
to
the
patients
and
the
skill
she
brings
to
work
each
day
ldquo
sam
works
very
well
with
families
she
bonds
with
the
kids
and
she
loves
the
kids
part
of
that
no
doubt
is
her
personality
but
some
of
it
is
from
her
know
how
from
the
patient
advocacy
program
rdquo
the
programs
influence
on
dreyer
berry
kravis
recalled
really
shined
when
patients
family
requested
support
document
for
their
insurance
normally
that
would
be
something
berry
kravis
would
fill
out
but
dreyer
offered
to
do
it
berry
kravis
worried
that
she
would
have
to
heavily
edit
whatever
dreyer
wrote
to
her
surprise
it
was
exactly
what
the
family
needed

one

things

they

to
help
them

in

16

49

making
visits
every

to

kraviss
npc
clinic
to
receive
lumbar
puncture
that
delivers
cyclodextrin
directly
into

thanks
to
that
treatment
alec
has
full
and
vibrant
life
just
like
any
other
young
adult
he
is
quick
to
joke
around
with
his
mom
and
competitive
while
video
gaming
with
his

he
plays
in
local
basketball

works
at

retail

and
even
finds
time
to
