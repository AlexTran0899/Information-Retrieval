into
an
ambush
near
the
klan
office
the
students
encountered
group
that
included
prepared
klansmen
the
police
and
the
sheriff
rsquo
deputies
bottles
and
rocks
flew
through
the
air
bats
and
police
clubs
cracked
down
on
skulls
and
backs
the
students
fought
back
throwing
punches
and
organizing
into
flying
wedges
like
the
football
team
bloody
and
bruised
many
of
them
retreated
to
regroup
at
the
county
courthouse
few
blocks
away

would
be
too
great
price
to
pay

dislike
very

to

make
explanations
to
the
parents
of
any

who
might
be
injured
mdash
or
even
killed

indeed
the
amazing
thing
was
that
no
one
was
killed
that
night
the
students
heeded
their
president
rsquo
direct
command
and
marched
back
to
campus
the
aftermath
while
walsh
and
the
university
never
disciplined
the
students
there
were
lectures
and
pledges
not
to
riot
again
coach
rockne
wrapped
up
rambling
speech
by
telling
them
that
football
team
must
follow
its
quarterback
ldquo
father
walsh
is
your
quarterback
and
you
are
the
great
notre

team
rdquo
rockne
said
ldquo
it
is
your
duty
to
follow
the
signals
of
father

and
when
you
do
you
will
be
in
the
right
and
will
not
be
party
to
any
disorder
