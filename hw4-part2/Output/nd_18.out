in

shows
that
the

are
incredibly
valuable
for

especially
for
helping
to
commit
information

for

when

regions

especially
those

processing
information
and

are
actually
more
active

payne
rsquo
research
indicates
all
of
us
could
benefit
if
we
took
nap
each
day
the
trick
is
keeping
your
naps
brief
enough
or
long
enough
so
that
you
don
rsquo
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
sleep
cycle
and
feel
groggy
or
fatigued
after
whatever
the
duration
payne
rsquo
data
suggests
we
never
should
rsquo
ve
left

naps
in

the
ideal
time
to
take
nap
is
in
the
afternoon
after
lunch

you

catching

adults
are
typically
told
they
need
about
eight
hours
of
sleep
each
night
while
the
majority
of
us
do
need
between
seven
and
nine
hours
payne
points
out
that
the
amount
of
sleep
needed
by
adults
is
normally
distributed
meaning
that
while
rare
there
are
those
among
us
who
do
just
fine
on
four
or
five
hours
and
some
who
need
more
than
nine
the
bad
news
of
course
is
that
most
of
us
do
not
get
the
sleep
we
need
the
good
news
payne
explains
that
just
20
more
minutes
of
shuteye
on
regular
basis
will
help
you
