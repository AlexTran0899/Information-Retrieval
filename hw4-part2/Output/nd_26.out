pierattini
an

created

called

isha
lab
to
prove
that
the

is
in
fact
the
earliest
known
structure
in
greece
that
led
centuries
later
to
the
prominent
columns
of
the
classical
greek
temple
to
picture
this
iconic
style
think
of
the

lincoln
memorial
in
washington
and
its
central
shrine

statue
with

all

it
the
lincoln

is
modeled
after
the
famous
parthenon

but
why

pierattini
said
there
has
been
long
standing
question
of
who
invented
the
idea
of
building
temple
with
columns
all
around
it
what
is
called
the
peristyle
that
characterizes
classical
architecture
some
have
hypothesized
that
the
greeks
learned
the
concept
from
similar
temples
in

thousands
of
years
earlier

discovered

used
evidence

the

greek

than
feet
long
and
45
feet
wide
the
structure
is
10
times
larger
than

known
buildings
from
this
period
archaeologists
believe
it
was
used
as
wealthy
couples
home
before
becoming
their
burial
site
including
jewelry
and
sacrificed
horses
because
the
toumba
building
dates
back
to
the
10
th
century
experts
believe
it
could
not
have
been
copied
from
egyptian
temples

there

scholars
widely
accepted
that
this
gap
proved
that
the
greeks
did
not
copy
the
peristyle
from
egypt
the
toumba
building
was
the
missing
link
proving
the
greeks
developed
the
classical
style
on
their
own
until
thats
when
architectural
historian
georg
herdt
published
study
questioning
the
evidence
of
peristyle
based
on
structural
analysis
of
the
toumba
building
herdt
determined
that
the
interior
posts
could
not
have
supported
the

coulton
calculated
and
that
the
exterior

could
have
been
from

said
surprisingly
even
by

this

designed
it
was
certainly
stable

so
our

numerical

demonstrated
this

does
deserve
its
place
in
every
book
of

pierattini
believes
the
structural
data
backs
up
what
coulton
proposed
about
the
alignment
of
the
postholes
the
outer
and
inner
postholes
form
straight
lines
that
suggest

connections
the
isha
team
presented
preliminary
data
to
an
international
group
of
experts
in
an
online

colloquium
in

pierattini
said
more
refined
data
will
be
presented
at
future
meeting
of
the
archaeological
institute
of
america
and
he
is
working
on
an
article
he
hopes
to
publish
next
year
in
the
peer
reviewed
annual
of
the
british
school
at
athens
top
journal
from
cambridge
university
im
the
author
so
im
obviously
biased
but
think
this
will
answer
the
question
of
whether
this
is
the
first
known
peripteral
building
in
greek
history
once
it
is
published
pierattini
said
its
also
interesting
because
we
need
to
develop
common
interdisciplinary
language
between
architects
physicists
and
engineers
imagine
it
will
be
very
