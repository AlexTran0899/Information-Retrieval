avian
ecologist
steve
kolbe
with
the
natural
resources
research
institute
nrri
at
the
university
of
minnesota
duluth
answers
questions
about
migratory
bird
populations
in
minnesota
their
migration
routes
and
patterns
and
the
condition
of
their
habitats
what
species
of
migratory
birds
are
commonly
found
in
minnesota
and
where
kolbe
nbsp
minnesota
contains
varied
habitats
from
grasslands
in
the
west
and
bottomland
deciduous
forests
in
the
southeast
to
boreal
forests
in
the
north
the
combination
of
these
habitats
in
single
state
means
that
minnesota
is
an
extremely
biodiverse
state
during
migration
and
the
summer
breeding
season
additionally
the
harsh
winter
conditions
we
experience
in
minnesota
mean
the
majority
of
birds
migrate
away
from
the
state
each
fall
combine
these
two
factors
and
we
see
massive
numbers
of
birds
of
wide
range
of
species
leaving
and
returning
to
the
state
each
year
minnesota
is
also
fortunate
because
its
the
end
of
the
migratory
journey
for
wide
range
of
species
that
spend
the
summer
in
the
state
many
southern
states
see
species
such
as
warblers
only
during
spring
and
fall
migration
but
in
minnesota
we
get
to
enjoy
them
all
summer
long
one
of
the
first
signs
of
spring
is
the
huge
flocks
of
geese
and
waterfowl
that
arrive
as
soon
as
open
water
is
available
this
year
many
of
these
species
migrated
north
very
early
due
to
the
mild
winter
and
lack
of
ice
cover
in
the
early
spring
eagles
and
hawks
migrate
back
in
large
numbers
throughout
march
and
april
these
birds
are
soon
accompanied
by
the
arrival
of
short
distance
migrants
such
as
american
robins
red
winged
blackbirds
and
eastern
bluebirds
that
have
spent
the
winter
in
the
southern
united
states
after
the
weather
warms
and
leaves
start
to
appear
on
trees
long
distance
migrants
species
that
have
spent
the
winter
in
central
or
south
america
such
as
orioles
tanagers
grosbeaks
and
warblers
begin
to
arrive
and
prepare
for
the
breeding
season
birdwatchers
are
able
to
see
well
over
species
of
birds
in
morning
during
this
peak
spring
migration
season
along
migratory
corridors
such
as
the
minnesota
and
mississippi
rivers
and
lake
superior
in
the
fall
this
pattern
is
reversed
long
distance
migrants
leave
as
early
as
late
july
and
early
august
and
short
distance
migrants
trickle
south
throughout
september
and
early
october
eagle
and
hawk
numbers
peak
in
october
as
the
weather
starts
to
turn
and
finally
the
small
number
of
hardy
migratory
species
such
as
finches
that
spend
the
winter
in
minnesota
arrive
in
november
and
december
what
is
the
typical
migration
route
for
these
migratory
birds
and
how
do
they
get
there
kolbe
nbsp
migration
routes
vary
depending
on
the
species
and
the
location
of
their
non
breeding
grounds
for
most
species
the
well
worn
concept
of
migratory
flyways
is
gross
oversimplification
spring
migration
routes
that
end
in
places
as
distant
as
alaska
and
hudson
bay
cross
in
minnesota
similarly
birds
that
winter
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
atlantic
coast
and
central
and
south
america
all
pass
through
the
state
in
the
fall
in
general
most
spring
migrants
fly
as
directly
as
possible
to
their
breeding
grounds
in
order
to
occupy
the
best
territories
as
quickly
as
possible
in
the
fall
birds
will
often
take
more
southeasterly
route
at
more
leisurely
pace
to
get
to
their
wintering
grounds
the
majority
of
bird
species
migrate
at
night
and
use
multiple
cues
to
help
them
navigate
in
darkness
including
magnetic
and
polarized
light
fields
and
the
stars
during
typical
night
of
migration
an
individual
bird
likely
tries
to
travel
as
far
as
it
can
given
its
energy
stores
and
the
flying
conditions
some
species
such
as
tundra
swans
and
sandhill
cranes
are
dependent
on
very
specific
habitats
during
migration
and
will
follow
traditional
migratory
routes
and
stop
at
the
exact
same
areas
each
year
because
these
species
migrate
in
groups
often
including
adults
and
their
offspring
knowledge
of
these
prime
stopover
areas
is
passed
down
to
future
generations
species
that
migrate
during
the
day
are
much
more
likely
to
use
geographic
landmarks
like
river
valleys
or
lake
shorelines
as
landmarks
and
to
use
soaring
flight
which
utilizes
updrafts
off
ridgelines
or
thermals
of
rising
air
produced
by
the
uneven
heating
of
the
earths
surface
how
and
what
changes
in
habitats
impact
migratory
birds
and
their
migratory
behavior
kolbe
nbsp
of
the
approximately
species
that
are
regularly
detected
in
minnesota
nearly
breed
in
the
state
quality
habitat
that
provides
food
and
shelter
is
critical
for
birds
during
migration
and
for
breeding
activities
in
terms
of
migration
the
majority
of
birds
are
relatively
flexible
and
use
any
available
stopover
habitat
that
they
can
find
some
bird
species
stop
for
day
or
even
few
hours
during
which
time
they
try
to
regain
fat
stores
used
to
migrate
by
eating
as
much
as
possible
other
birds
stay
for
much
longer
to
refuel
or
wait
for
nice
weather
before
making
another
migratory
flight
for
all
species
habitat
quantity
and
quality
are
the
most
pressing
concerns
if
bird
is
unable
to
find
enough
suitable
stopover
habitat
it
will
be
unable
to
refuel
and
make
another
migratory
leap
because
human
presence
on
the
landscape
in
much
of
the
state
is
high
we
must
make
sure
that
as
much
natural
habitat
is
saved
as
possible
additionally
if
bird
stops
over
at
site
of
lower
quality
such
as
site
filled
with
invasive
plant
species
it
may
take
much
longer
to
gain
enough
nutrients
to
prepare
for
the
next
leg
of
the
journey
ensuring
high
quality
stop
over
and
breeding
habitat
is
available
for
all
birds
is
top
priority
for
bird
conservation
how
do
migratory
birds
respond
to
extreme
weather
events
kolbe
nbsp
birds
have
an
amazing
ability
to
respond
to
changes
in
the
weather
in
the
spring
birds
are
incentivized
by
the
choice
of
good
breeding
territories
to
arrive
on
the
breeding
grounds
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
for
them
to
find
food
and
survive
however
when
unexpected
weather
such
as
the
snow
and
ice
storms
we
sometimes
experience
in
the
spring
occur
birds
will
often
reverse
course
and
migrate
south
until
conditions
improve
before
heading
farther
north
what
are
you
doing
to
advance
research
on
minnesotas
migratory
birds
kolbe
nbsp
the
avian
ecology
lab
at
the
natural
resources
research
institute
is
on
the
cutting
edge
of
the
study
of
migratory
bird
species
in
minnesota
we
specialize
in
using
the
latest
technology
to
answer
questions
about
how
where
when
and
why
birds
migrate
for
example
along
with
collaborators
across
north
america
we
have
placed
geolocators
and
gps
tags
on
common
terns
american
woodcock
and
golden
winged
warblers
in
order
to
understand
migration
routes
and
where
they
spend
the
winter
our
group
is
also
heavily
involved
in
global
effort
called
the
motus
wildlife
tracking
system
the
goal
of
this
project
is
to
use
automated
telemetry
to
track
the
migratory
movements
of
birds
that
are
too
small
to
be
equipped
with
more
sophisticated
gps
tracking
devices
our
group
currently
has
nine
stations
along
the
north
and
south
shore
of
lake
superior
these
stations
have
detected
birds
that
were
tagged
as
far
away
as
maryland
and
british
columbia
these
new
technologies
have
helped
us
to
start
to
unravel
the
mysteries
of
migration
and
help
inform
conservation
of
minnesota
birds
