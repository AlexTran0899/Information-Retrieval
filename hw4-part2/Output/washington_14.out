more
thoughts
from
anthony
for
me
the
center
means
comfort
being
mixed
race
person
of
color
but
also
being
gay
man
find
lot
of
circles
hard
to
navigate
and
many
of
those
circles
are
exclusive
to
certain
identities
so
don
feel
comfortable
in
the
full
experience
of
me
the
center
is
one
of
those
few
environments
where
can
just
completely
be
every
aspect
of
myself
and
feel
comfortable
we
need
to
create
more
environments
for
people
who
experience
marginalization
to
the
strongest
extent
because
it
benefits
those
who
aren
as
marginalized
indirectly
as
queer
people
were
raised
on
this
idea
that
we
should
take
up
less
space
we
re
told
to
keep
ourselves
small
and
hide
components
of
ourselves
so
major
issue
is
to
recognize
the
importance
of
space
and
how
much
space
you
re
giving
people
because
look
how
much
we
re
flourishing
in
small
space
could
you
imagine
something
medium
and
gosh
don
get
me
started
on
large
my
favorite
thing
about
the
center
is
the
friendships
ive
made
have
some
of
the
dumbest
conversations
in
here
and
ive
never
once
thought
they
were
counterproductive
would
much
rather
have
casual
and
meaningful
conversation
in
the
center
than
more
intellectually
stimulating
one
outside
would
like
people
to
know
that
as
much
as
they
find
comfort
and
solace
in
those
environments
that
don
like
football
game
for
example
that
experience
of
camaraderie
that
comfort
and
sense
of
belonging
we
re
getting
that
here
it
just
looks
different

more
thoughts
from
valerie
when
came
here
in
was
struggling
to
find
mentors
and
people
who
aligned
with
my
values
and
understood
what
it
means
to
be
not
only
person
of
color
but
also
queer
and
thats
something
found
support
for
in
the
center
working
here
has
opened
so
many
doors
for
me
ive
been
going
to
conferences
giving
talks
and
trainings
across
campus
and
partnering
with
external
organizations
also
building
community
and
finding
the
support
need
its
valuable
to
have
this
physical
space
were
always
here
even
if
you
arent
out
yet
and
your
first
year
you
feel
kind
of
intimidated
or
scared
to
be
so
visible
in
this
space
its
okay
you
can
come
back
your
sophomore
year
your
junior
year
your
senior
year
the
faces
may
look
different
but
our
space
and
what
we
stand
for
will
still
be
here
in
lot
of
spaces
people
of
color
queer
people
and
trans
people
are
silenced
marginalized
and
not
listened
to
or
attended
to
you
often
dont
feel
like
you
can
be
outspoken
or
open
about
who
you
are
you
make
yourself
small
in
those
spaces
just
for
safety
and
security
the
center
is
space
where
you
can
show
up
as
your
full
self
and
feel
empowered
to
take
on
projects
and
launch
them
please
support
our
work
don
undervalue
it
were
tiny
but
very
mighty
and
vital
to
this
campus
and
this
community
if
you
don
find
your
flock
it
feels
hard
to
navigate
and
just
exist
because
you
re
not
being
seen
and
heard
at
the
end
of
the
day
all
care
about
is
keeping
students
alive
particularly
those
who
have
multiple
marginalized
identities

more
thoughts
from
jaime
grew
up
in
large
adoptive
family
and
we
all
have
different
blended
racial
and
ethnic
identities
went
to
high
school
in
conservative
place
and
most
people
didnt
look
like
me
had
the
experience
of
feeling
like
an
other
it
felt
like
had
to
choose
between
identities
that
knew
to
be
fluid
and
complex
remember
going
to
the
unofficial
opening
of
the
center
which
at
the
time
was
operating
out
of
closet
in
the
hub
it
was
very
affirming
because
the
center
talked
about
liberation
and
that
was
something
id
never
discussed
before
what
it
would
look
like
to
feel
free
to
feel
affirmed
to
be
in
world
with
no
oppression
began
to
increase
my
leadership
skills
by
getting
involved
in
queer
organizations
and
facilitating
conversations
about
the
intersections
of
race
gender
and
sexuality
later
became
the
centers
social
justice
programmer
and
did
my
social
work
practicum
here
gained
the
ability
to
create
space
for
folks
to
come
in
and
feel
comfortable
sharing
their
story
jen
self
center
director
was
an
amazing
mentor
to
me
they
supported
projects
wanted
to
implement
helped
me
navigate
applying
to
graduate
school
and
just
believed
in
me
when
you
hear
that
who
you
are
is
enough
valuable
and
unique
it
builds
confidence
that
is
necessary
to
be
able
to
navigate
complex
issues
such
as
identity
and
justice
because
of
the
center
ve
gone
from
being
strong
background
player
to
putting
myself
out
in
the
forefront
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
this
space
before
thought
that
as
queer
person
of
color
had
to
be
absolutely
perfect
to
get
anything
after
graduate
school
became
the
associate
director
of
the
center
it
was
powerful
to
be
able
to
support
students
in
finding
their
inner
voice
hearing
students
experiences
has
always
shaped
the
programming
of
the
center
its
really
important
to
talk
about
our
experiences
instead
of
pushing
them
down
and
thats
why
we
have
an
informal
conversation
space
here
by
learning
in
community
and
learning
how
to
engage
with
each
other
were
able
to
thrive
and
break
barriers
to
achieve
equity
