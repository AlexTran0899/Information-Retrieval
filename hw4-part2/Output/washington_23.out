danyelle
thomas
07
became
doctor
to
help
improve
the
health
outcomes
of
underserved
communities
starting
with
her
own
the
name
rang
bell
at
the
bustling
admit
desk
of
seattles
carolyn
downs
family
medical
center
dr
danyelle
thomas
07
picked
up
patients
chart
and
was
transported
back
to
middle
school
the
chart
was
for
classmate
she
hadnt
seen
in
years
it
was
scene
that
would
replay
in
various
forms
at
this
central
district
clinic
over
thomas
three
year
residency
sometimes
it
was
the
familiar
face
of
childhood
friend
in
the
hallway
or
an
aunt
who
stopped
to
say
hello
before
an
annual
checkup
for
thomas
university
of
washington
alumna
whose
family
roots
run
deep
in
seattles
historic
african
american
neighborhood
the
residency
was
more
than
just
an
opportunity
to
hone
her
skills
as
physician
it
was
chance
to
improve
the
well
being
of
the
community
that
made
her
who
she
is

previous
next
there
are
so
many
communities
that
are
marginalized
to
the
point
where
people
write
them
and
their
experiences
off
says
thomas
who
finished
her
residency
in
june
and
now
practices
at
href
pacific
medical
center
on
beacon
hill
was
kind
of
an
underdog
in
becoming
doctor
so
want
to
help
people
who
need
the
help
thomas
didnt
have
to
look
far
to
see
that
african
americans
are
more
likely
than
other
americans
to
suffer
heart
attacks
die
from
cancer
and
have
chronic
diseases
that
go
unchecked
these
disparities
are
the
result
of
many
factors
including
systemic
racism
in
and
beyond
health
care
studies
show
that
black
patients
benefit
from
having
black
doctors
like
thomas
with
higher
levels
of
trust
shared
decision
making
and
other
positive
outcomes
but
thomas
is
an
outlier
in
her
profession
fewer
than
5
of
working
physicians
are
african
american
and
even
fewer
are
black
women
we
need
physicians
that
look
like
the
patients
so
theres
an
inherent
trust
and
bond
there

to
do
more
and
be
more
thomas
was
the
first
in
her
family
to
attend
four
year
college
and
medical
school
but
shes
not
the
first
to
chart
pioneering
course
in
health
care
her
grandmother
5

6
inch
force
of
nature
moved
to
seattle
in
the
to
become
one
of
the
areas
few
black
nurses
her
mother
too
is
retired
nurse
who
worked
at
the
same
beacon
hill
clinic
where
thomas
now
practices
but
thomas
didnt
consider
medicine
until
after
she
graduated
from
the
uw
where
she
earned
degree
in
biochemistry
and
math
minor
with
the
support
of
the
costco
diversity
scholarship
given
to
high
achieving
students
from
underrepresented
communities
the
scholarship
was
vote
of
confidence
that
made
thomas
want
to
do
more
and
be
more
while
working
for
seattle
pharmaceutical
company
testing
prostate
cancer
treatment
thomas
saw
that
african
americans
made
up
shockingly
low
percentage
of
the
clinical
trial
participants
despite
being
more
likely
than
others
to
get
and
die
from
the
cancer
it
was
glaring
inequity
that
frustrated
and
disappointed
her
but
ultimately
motivated
her
if
we
know
there
huge
population
that
can
be
helped
why
aren
we
doing
more
she
remembers
wondering
at
the
time
thats
when
thought
maybe
should
be
doctor
inspired
to
help
both
individuals
and
whole
populations
she
applied
and
was
accepted
to
four
year
combined
medicine
and
masters
of
public
health
program
at
the
university
of
miami
even
that
process
illuminated
some
of
the
barriers
to
diversifying
the
physician
workforce
didnt
have
lot
of
the
opportunities
afforded
to
my
peers
says
thomas
who
worked
full
time
while
studying
for
the
mcats
while
many
of
her
fellow
medical
students
had
taken
the
summer
off
to
prepare
there
are
many
things
that
come
with
money
and
opportunities
that
the
people
we
need
to
be
doctors
cant
access
throughout
the
grueling
often
isolating
years
of
medical
school
thomas
family
and
friends
cheered
her
on
from
miles
away
she
was
overjoyed
when
she
matched
to
the
swedish
family
medicine
residency
program
at
carolyn
downs
about
mile
from
the
house
in
which
both
she
and
her
father
had
grown
up
it
meant
being
closer
to
her
support
group
and
back
in
the
community
she
wanted
to
serve
her
own

and

sinegal
coming
home
from
the
moment
thomas
walked
through
the
doors
of
the
carolyn
downs
family
medical
center
she
felt
at
home
founded
by
the
seattle
chapter
of
the
black
panther
party
the
clinic
sits
on
the
same
central
district
sidewalks
she
had
walked
in
her
youth
on
the
way
to
church
and
to
school
at
garfield
high
and
the
clinics
mission
aligned
with
her
own
to
improve
the
whole
communitys
health
on
any
given
day
thomas
saw
broad
spectrum
of
that
community
from
newborns
to
octogenarians
one
of
her
goals
is
to
help
patients
understand
their
own
health
she
knows
how
vital
it
is
that
people
have
access
to
medical
information
in
plain
language
people
should
know
whats
going
on
thomas
says
when
somebody
has
high
blood
pressure
get
animated
explain
theres
medication
to
help
lower
your
blood
pressure
and
thats
important
because
youre
more
likely
to
have
this
other
problem
if
you
dont
take
it
those
messages
are
easier
to
deliver
when
patients
can
see
themselves
in
their
doctors
at
her
practice
on
beacon
hill
thomas
is
the
only
black
primary
care
physician
when
she
walks
into
the
exam
room
her
patients
are
excited
and
grateful
to
see

we
need

that

so
theres
an
inherent
trust
and
bond
there
says
thomas
we
are
the
same
but
just
happen
to
be
the
doctor
think
thats
really
important
in
the
way
talk
explain
and
relate
to
patients
thats
why
representation
matters
to
her
its
also
why
she
spends
little
extra
time
with
her
youngest
patients
encouraging
them
to
try
out
her
stethoscope
or
look
in
her
ear
before
she
looks
in
theirs
we
have
to
start
nurturing
it
early
before
they
even
go
to
school
because
high
school
is
almost
too
late
thomas
says
her
goal
is
for
black
doctors
to
be
commonplace
