the
original
experiments
that
made
the
wireless
services
used
every
day
are
not
as
old
as
some
might
think
in
fact
it
was
just
years
ago
that
the
first
known
long
range
wireless
transmission
in
the
united
states
was
made
on
the
campus
of
the
university
of
notre
dame
the
road
to
the
first
known
long
distance
us
transmission
in
italy
during
late
and
early
italian
inventor
guglielmo
marconi
was
experimenting
with
transmitting
radio
signals
over
gradually
greater
distances
he
found
that
his
signals
traveled
and
were
received
even
from
inside
building
to
the
outdoors
with
the
windows
and
doors
both
open
and
closed
the
discovery
encouraged
marconi
and
his
team
he
worked
on
his
equipment
studying
other
innovators
of
the
day
and
gradually
increased
the
transmission
distance
to
mile
he
would
later
move
to
britain
to
continue
his
experiments

building
on

successes
notre
dame
professor
jerome
green
and
his
assistants
began
building
their
own
transmission
equipment
they
started
the
same
way
marconi
did
by
sending
signals
from
rooms
within
the
science
hall
which
today
is
lafortune
student
center
and
progressed
to
sending
signals
from
the
science
hall
to
sorin
hall
on
campus
according
to
an
article
in
notre
dame
scholastic
on
april
22
green
was
determined
to
have
his
assistants
at
the
forefront
of
radio
transmission
technology
he
has
had
them
working
all
this
week
on
the
marconi
wireless
telegraphy
the
article
reads
so
far
as
we
can
learn
they
have
been
more
successful
in
operating
here
thus
far
than
others
have
been
in
any
other
institution
in

these
experiments
caught

attention

reads
the
headline
of
the
chicago
daily
news
april
18
edition
in
this
article
green
said
it
is
the
first
time
that
successful
experiments
have
been
performed
with
apparatus
which
was
not
imported
from
foreign
countries
for
the
purpose
of
course
feel
the
least
bit
proud
to
think
am
the
first
to
make
the
equipment
in
this
country
perhaps
am
claiming
an
honor
which
does
not
belong
to
me
but
if
there
is
any
other
person
in
this
country
who
has
done
the
work
with
his
own
machinery
have
not
heard
of
him
the
distance
of
successful
transmissions
continued
to
grow
and
on
april
19
green
and
his
team
used
the
basilica
of
the
sacred
hearts
tower
to
transmit
long

signal
green

who
encouraged

who
collaborated
on
experiments
at
the
time
the
event
is
detailed
in
the
april
22
issue
of
notre

scholastic
it
took
two
or
three
hours
to
get
everything
ready
and
everyone
at
the
school
was
anxiously
waiting
for
the
trial
to
be
made
when
everything
was
finished
and
the
operator
pressed
the
key
and
sent
signal
reply
came
back
from
the

saying
that
it
had
been
received
all
right
this
is
the
farthest
distance
message
has
been
sent
in
this
country
as
far
as
we
know
and
the
boys
in
the
scientific
department
feel
elated
over
their
success
professor
green
is
preparing
new
apparatus
and
will
make
further
experiments
in
the
near
future
ironically
the
wireless
transmission
was
confirmed
to
be
success
between
greens
and
antonines
teams
using
landline
telephone
call
between

the

official
account
of
the

to
be

today
without

if

like
greens
were
used
today
it
would
interrupt

nick

ph

discuss
the
modern
day
re
enactment
of
jerome
green
experiment
in
the
modern
day
re
enactment
chisum
and
his
team
had
to
conduct
their
own
experiments
to
find
the
best
ways
to
transmit
and
receive
the
signal
in
there
was
only
one
transmitter
and
only
one
receiver
accessing
the
radio
spectrum
in
the
entire
geographic
area
green
was
free
to
transmit
at
very
high
power
across
wide
range
of
frequencies
that
today
are
used
for
critical
infrastructure
with
only
one
transmitter
active
at
the
time
the
receiver
at
saint
marys
could
be
triggered
based
on
signals
at
any
frequency
through
early
outdoor
tests
chisum
and
his
colleagues
quickly
realized
that
the
coherer
receiver
would
be
constantly
activated
by
the
many
other
wireless
signals
using
the
spectrum
today
rendering
communications
impractical
they
would
have
to
find
way
to
avoid
producing
interference
to
other
receivers
and
to
protect
their
receiver
from
being
interfered
with
by
other
transmitters
chisum
and
hochwald
co
director
of
the
wireless
institute
developed
spark
gap
transmitter
similar
to
the
one
used
by
green
and
marconi
but
found
that
it
violated
federal
communications
commission
fcc
regulations
even
filtering
the
transmitter
to
open
bands
was
not
sufficient
ultimately
they
decided
to
attempt
to
transmit
their
signal
in
low
frequency
amateur
radio
band
allocation
on
which
the
fcc
allows
high
powered
transmissions

50

even

it

the
radio
spectrum
in
the
background
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
has
become
quite
crowded
since
the
first
known
wireless
communications
ghosh
explained
that
this
means
we
need
to
manage
spectrum
more
effectively
and
share
between
different
use
cases
without
causing
harmful
interference
this
is
challenging
because
some
of
the
systems
requiring
spectrum
resources
are
critical
to
national
security
in
suburban
area
with
lot
of
land
one
can
build
neighborhood
of
well
spaced
out
single
family
homes
ghosh
said
in
dense
urban
environment
however
where
land
is
scarce
one
needs
to
build
vertically
hence
you
layer
different
uses
into
the
same
bit
of
space
spectrum
is
similar
when
many
use
cases
are
competing
for
the
same
spectrum
using
technology
to
share
spectrum
effectively
in
time
frequency
and
or
space
is
becoming
increasingly
important
considering
the
need
for
future
growth
and
investment
in
spectrum
research
nick
laneman
co
director
of
the
wireless
institute
and
director
of
spectrumx
said
now
is
pivotal
time
to
both
learn
from
the
past
and
work
with
collaborators
to
innovate
for
the
future
the
success
of
all
of
these
technologies
and
the
applications
of
wireless
is
now
creating
this
challenge
of
balancing
the
many
uses
of
the
radio
spectrum
the
timing
is
fascinating
because
of
the
discussion
happening
right
now
around
the
us
national
spectrum
strategy
and
how
spectrumx
can
contribute
he
said
at
notre
dame
we
are
deeply
embedded
in
that
discussion
and
related
research
projects
through
the
center
and
through
other
initiatives
we
are
involved
in
we
are
working
to
make
academic
research
more
useful
to
policymakers
it
is
pivotal
moment
in
wireless
innovation
and
regulation
in
the
united
states
the
university
of
notre
dame
working
with
its
many
partners
including
saint
marys
college
continues
to
be
at
the
forefront
of
wireless
technology
policy
and
research
as
the
university
celebrates
years
of

the
researchers
look
