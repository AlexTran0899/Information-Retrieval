energized
for
change
after
seeing
the
devastation
of
hurricanes
in
puerto
rico
grad
student
miguel
gonzlez
montijo
is
working
on
clean
energy
innovations
for
the
future
this
has
been
beautiful
journey
that
has
seen
me
grow
first
as
person
and
then
as
an
engineer
as
hurricane
maria
tore
through
arecibo
puerto
rico
in
miguel
gonzlez
montijo
hunkered
down
at
home
with
his
family
they
were
no
strangers
to
hurricanes
just
two
weeks
earlier
category
5
hurricane
irma
had
skirted
the
island
demolishing
homes
causing
floods
and
knocking
out
power
for
more
than
million
people
and
now
maria
with
wind
speeds
up
to
mph
was
hitting
puerto
rico
dead
on
arecibo
with
its
peaceful
golden
beaches
and
lush
hills
rising
behind
it
was
now
maelstrom
of
howling
wind
and
driving
rain

after
hurricane
maria
puerto
rico
endured
the
longest
blackout
in
history
it
created
unity
among
us
says
gonzlez
montijo
we
depended
on
one
another
human
caused
climate
change
was
already
leading
to
warmer
oceans
enabling
more
frequent
and
more
powerful
hurricanes
but
gonzlez
montijo
wasnt
thinking
that
far
ahead
he
was
wondering
when
puerto
ricos
power
grid
would
recover
and
trying
to
distract
himself
by
studying
for
graduate
school
entrance
exams
by
lamplight
after
earning
his
bachelors
in
engineering
at
the
university
of
puerto
rico
at
mayagez
he
was
deciding
between
finding
job
or
pursuing
graduate
studies
once
the
winds
subsided
he
and
his
family
went
outside
to
survey
the
scene
everything
was
destroyed
he
says
the
streets
were
filled
with
trees
light
posts
and
electrical
cables
it
soon
became
clear
just
how
bad
the
situation
was
full
97
of
puerto
ricos
electricity
is
generated
by
fossil
fuels
and
must
travel
over
rugged
mountains
and
through
dense
jungle
en
route
to
its
customers
and
now
that
electrical
grid
was
in
shambles
it
would
be
two
and
half
months
before
gonzlez
montijos
family
got
their
power
back
others
waited
nearly
year
it
was
the
longest
blackout
in
history
in
the
meantime
gonzlez
montijo
decided
to
pursue
graduate
degree
in
civil
and
environmental
engineering
he
knew
local
jobs
might
be
scarce
as
puerto
rico
slowly
recovered
and
there
was
lot
he
still
wanted
to
learn
hoping
to
eventually
return
home
with
skills
to
help
make
puerto
rico
more
resilient
accepted
to
schools
across
the
country
he
chose
the
university
of
washington
for
its
many
cross
disciplinary
research
opportunities
hes
now
on
the
cusp
of
earning
his
doctorate
his
intellectual
curiosity
led
him
to
clean
energy
and
at
the
uw
he
found
community
of
people
in
fields
from
electrical
engineering
and
public
policy
to
chemistry
and
physics
who
shared
his
growing
passion
the
uw
has
become

away

the

has
been

gonzlez

learned
that
marine
energy
combined
with
microgrids
localized

grids
could
help
puerto

and
other
places
recover
from
natural

he
got

with

project
to
more
efficiently
and
economically
produce
marine
hydrokinetic
turbine
blades
essentially
propellers
that
harness

using

roots
he
says
noting
that
he
felt
supported
to
delve
into
the
nuances
of
his
field
and
build
multidisciplinary
connections
but
the
best
part
has
been
the
people
who
have
been
caring

since

beautiful

not

after

gonzlez

remembers
the
intense
humidity
that
clung
to
him
like

the
smell
of

vegetation
lingered
on

clean

the

owls

stayed
eerily
quiet
the

gradually
they
reemerged
and
resumed
their
nighttime
calls
it
would
take
the
people
of
puerto
rico
much
longer
to
begin
returning
to
life
as
usual
if
we
were
using
other
sources
of

perhaps
there
wouldnt
be
such
dire
situation
every

we
get
natural
disaster
says
gonzlez
montijo
he
has
hope
though
clean
energy
technology
is
seeing
huge
advances
that
could
make
difference
around
the
world
in
fact
he
says
nrel
is
studying
how
to
best
deploy
marine
and
wind
power
and
microgrids
in
puerto
rico
and
communities
there
are
already
starting
solar
powered
microgrids
of
their
own
there
is
one
positive
that
gonzlez
montijo
remembers
from
the
aftermath
of
hurricane
maria
it
created
unity
among
us
we
depended
on
one
another
it
brought
us
all
closer

perhaps
clean

future

gonzlez
