we
hope
that
all
students
leave
princeton
more
service
minded
than
when
they
arrived
and
that
civic
engagement
has
become
central
part
of
their
lives
whether
they
choose
to
volunteer
with
groups
in
their
local
communities
or
choose
careers
in
service
some
princetonians
choose
to
embark
on
postgraduate
fellowships
many
supported
by
alumni
groups
that
match
young
alumni
with
nonprofit
organizations
such
programs
include
the
href
http://home.alumnicorps.org/
princeton
alumnicorps
and
href
http://www.princetoninafrica.org/
princeton
in
africa
many
alumni
are
leading
lives
of
service
for
example
wendy
kopp
member
of
the
class
of
founded
teach
for
america
mark
milley
graduate
is
chief
of
staff
of
the
army
alumni
can
also
engage
in
service
through
opportunities
at
princeton
service
activities
are
planned
each
year
at
reunions
and
at
alumni
conferences
to
keep
the
cycle
in
motion
alumni
can
reach
out
to
the
university
to
share
their
expertise
with
students
on
campus
and
they
can
host
students
in
their
