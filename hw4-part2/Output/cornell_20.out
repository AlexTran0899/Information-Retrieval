this

rather
than

because

something
interferes
with
it
specifically
an
extra
press
of
the
return
key
is
necessary
either
when
clicking
the
researcher

or
tabbing
into
it
in
order
for
the

to
play
when
pressing

function

on
the
research
page
when
researcher
tab
is
clicked
put
the
focus
on
the

play
button
so
that
pressing
return
causes
it
to
play
similarly
when
the

is
focused
via
