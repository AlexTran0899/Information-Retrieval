to
once

some
like
our

it
is
the
twilight
of
once
in

experience

some
returning
commodores
the
new
year
might
mean
working
toward
goals
of
landing
an
internship
job
or
graduate
school
acceptance
br
br
one
of
the
hardest
things
to
endure
for
our
students
and
parents
is
the
rate
at
which
others
seem
to
accomplish
their
goals
compared
to
themselves
whether
its
personal
rejection
or
not
making
the
cut
for
an
internship
job
or
school
remember
comparison
is
the
thief
of
all
joy
everyone
is
on
their
own
journey
and
land
where
they
were
meant
to
when
they
are
supposed
to
no
setback
or
accomplishment
signifies
persons
worth
br
br
the
college
years
go
by
at
warp
speed
enjoy
it
and
take
advantage
of
all
the
opportunities
vanderbilt
and
nashville

engagement
for
many
parents
the
prospect
of
their

receiving
college
education
is
taken
for
granted
for
some
it
represents
lifelong
dream
to
be
able
to
contribute
to
this

for
others
it
signifies
an
achievement
unprecedented

as

we
may
experience
emotions
twice
as
intensely
as
our
students
do
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
often
when
student
reaches
out
to
vent
we
carry
their
frustration
anxiety
and
worry
with
us
throughout
the
entire
day
and

while
they
may
have
moved
on
from
those
emotions
we
find
ourselves
still
holding

them
keep
in

that
very
little
falls
within
our
direct
control
but
larger
portion
is
within
our
sphere
of
influencewhere
we
can
provide

so
whether
they

with

with

ending
the
fall
semester
we
know
we
are
preaching
to
the
choir
when
we
say
that
vanderbilt
education
extends
far
beyond
the
classroom
our
students
possess
diverse
range
of
talents
and
interests
they
are
eager
to
pursue
immersion
vanderbilt
empowers
students
to
transform
their
passions
and
curiosities
into
immersive
experiences
that
not
only
deepen
their
understanding
but
also
allow
them
to
share
their
enthusiasm
with
others
when
it
was
first
introduced
as
graduation
requirement
in
some
may
have
seen
it
as
just
another
task
on
the
to
do
list
however
we
quickly
realized
that
this
was
not
the
case
students
take
what
they
are
already
passionate
about
and
apply
thoughtful
consideration
before
and
after
their
experience
in
order
to
share
it
what
immersion
experience
will
your
student
pursue
perhaps
your
student
will
leverage
it
as
an
opportunity
to
study
abroad
as
it
is
qualifying
experience
for
immersion
vanderbilt
students
have
dedicated
advisors
to
guide
them
through
the
immersion
process

the

requirement

you

for

and
to

the
four
milestones
of

while
studying

is
becoming
increasingly
common
across
universities
in
the
us
vanderbilt
stands
out
with
plus
programs
in
40
countries
students
studied
abroad
on
vanderbilt
approved
summer
maymester
and
academic
year
programs
during
the
academic
year
students
can
record
their
study
abroad
experience
along
with
other
experiences
they
engage
in
for
immersion
the
students
will
then
choose
one
experience
they
have
recorded
to
go
on
their
transcript
to
be
visible
to
graduate
schools
and
employers
declaring
study
abroad
for

can
qualify
students
for
additional
immersion
related
funding
opportunities
initially
we
did
not
think
it
was
feasible
for
our
son
to
study
abroad
given
his
mechanical
engineering
major
demanding
course
schedule
he
also
did
not
want
to
overwhelm
himself
with
multiple
challenging
courses
in
single
semester
however
with
the
assistance
of
advisors
and
careful
planning
he
found
program
that
seamlessly
fit
his
needs
without
disrupting
his
course
progression
or
wasting
credits
we
have
heard
that
students
from
various
majors
as
well
as
athletes
rotc
participants
and
performing
arts
students
face
similar
challenges
we
are
here
to
tell
you
that
it
not
impossible
or
inconvenient
planning
and
conversations
with
advisors
professors
and
deans
can
work
wonders
worried
about
the
cost
do
not
lose
hope
financial
aid
follows
students
and
additional
scholarships
can
be
available
discuss
this
with
your
student
and
explore
speaking
from
experience
highly
suggest
you
start
the
process
as
freshman
even
if
you
do
not
think
your
student
will
ultimately
go
it
is
better
to
be
prepared
in
the
event
window
opens
such
as
it
did
for
our
son
do
not
be
caught
in
the
stress
of
renewing
passport
like
us
it
is
important
to
note
that
at
minimum
passport
must
be
valid
through
the
semester
abroad
and
in
many
cases
at
least
six
months
after
the
program
ends
processing
time
for
renewal
of
passports
is
weeks
not
including
mailing
time
keep
in
mind
that
traveling
abroad
may
be
impossible
in
the
months
leading
up
to
the
study
abroad
application
since
you
may
have
to
surrender
your
passport
for
visa
application
speaking
of
visas
many
but
not
all
vanderbilt
study
abroad
destination
countries
require
an
entry
visa
for
us
passport
holders
if
visa
is
required
the
study
abroad
program
provider
will
offer
guidance
and
resources
for
the
visa
application
process
after
the
student
has
been
accepted
into
their
program
the
visa
application
process
materials
and
timeline
vary
widely
by
country
based
on
the
nationality
of
the
students
passport
and
some
require
an
in
person
appearance
at
consulate
group
visa
processing
services
are
currently
offered
for
programs
in
spain
students
opting
into
the
spanish
group
visa
processing
service
do
not
need
to
travel
to
spanish
consulate
however
for
us
since
my
son
was
in
the
middle
of
renewing
passport
that
would
expire
one
month
after
the
program
ends
he
could
not
make
the
group
visa
processing
service
deadline
he
now
has
to
apply
individually
and
may
be
required
to
appear
in
person
for
consulate
appointment
all
of
this
could
have
been
avoided
if
we
had
renewed
the
passport
year
ago
we
are
crossing
our
fingers
that
everything
will
come
together
in
time
for
the
departure
stay
tuned
in
all
our
frantic
web
research
emails
calls
and
follow
ups
we
learned
that
countries
other
than
spain
may
also
require
in
person
consulate
appearance
as
part
of
the
visa
application
students
will
need
to
work
closely
with
their
program
providers
and
should
read
through
all
provided
instructions
carefully
before
beginning
the

application
process

final
note
as
we
approach
the
end
of
the
fall
semester
thanksgiving
is
just
around
the
corner
and
many
families
are
eagerly
anticipating
their
students
return
home
if
you
are
parent
of

this
may
be
their
first
time
back
since
starting
their
college
journey
what
can
you
expect
from
them
laundry
hearty
meals
and
plenty
of
sleep
they
will
want
to
catch
up
on
rest
when
they
are
not
sleeping
they
may
be
eager
to
reconnect
with
high
school
friends
who
have
also
returned
home
while
it
is
natural
for
us
parents
to
feel
bit
left
out
and
wonder
what
about
us
consider
this
advice
proactively
schedule
family
time
and
meal
appointments
with
your
student
in
advance
but
also
leave
room
for
them
to
spend
time
with
friends
keep
in
mind
that
they
have
gotten
used
to
staying
out
late
and
imposing
high
school
curfew
might
not
go
over
well
it
is
good
idea
to
negotiate
this
before
they
return
wish
someone
had
told
me
this
when
my
oldest
came
home
for
the
first

it
would

lot
of
frustration

academic
advising
and
registration
as
we
seek
to
support
our
students
at
vanderbilt
wanted
to
share
some
information
about
registration
and
the
unique
approaches
to
academic
advising
across
four
undergraduate
schools
it
is
important
to
note
that
each
school
handles
advising
differently
however
they
all
utilize
the
href
home
undergraduate
catalog
to
guide
students
the
undergraduate
catalog
is
wealth
of
information
regarding
courses
of
study
at
vanderbilt
registration
is
by
periods
of
seniority
seniors
first
and
so
on
so
while
it
looks
as
if
some
classes
are
full
there
are
seats
held
for
the
following
periods
our
junior
says
if
students
find
class
truly
full
they
should
get
on
the
waitlist
email
the
professor
and
in
some
cases
attend
the
first
day
of
class
to
speak
to
said
professor
when
registering
be
online
early
and
ready
with
all

selections
in

have
several
backup
classes
build
your
schedule
with
enough
time
to
walk
to

manage
meal
times
and
busy
periods
unlike
many
universities
vanderbilt
students
graduate
in
4
years
they
always
get
the
classes
they
need
to
graduate
students
may
have
to
adjust
and
be
flexible
with
time
and
professor
and
or
class
electives
but
they
do
graduate
on
time
our
alumna
has
some
words
of
wisdom
for
your
commodore
regarding
registration
and
class
selection
she
says
took
lots
of
classes
did
not
plan
on
but
always
opted
to
do
the
interesting
fascinating
and
unique
elective
as
opposed
to
the
easy
or
cop
out
classes
they
always
ended
up
being
super
challenging
stressed
over
dropping
some
of
them
and
vented
lot
to
my
parents
but
hung
in
there
and
now
these
random
elective
classes
left
more
of
an
impression
on
me
than
most
what
learned
in
these
classes
has
been
most
valuable
for
real
life
post
vanderbilt
classes
such
as
philosophy
of
religion
challenged
me
to
think
critically
and
in
different
ways
because
of
this
class
that
took
my
freshman
year
became
better
writer
and
conversationalist
grew
in
confidence
because
of
it
ancient
grains
in
latin
america
afforded
me
the
ability
to
share
knowledge
and
insight
whenever
eat
or
travel
food
has
new
dimension
now
we
learned
about
human
civilizations
and
their
cultural
development
with
food
registered
for
korean
film
study
since
hallyu
is
such
big
thing
my
mom
even
thought
we
might
watch
the
films
together
and
discuss
nope
that
class
was
so
demanding
nearly
gave
up
several
times
the
professor
pulled
teased
out
and
stretched
what
thought
were
my
limits
of
analysis
and
evaluation
it
forever
changed
the
way
watch
movies
tell
stories
and
think
about
history
and
culture
so
the
next
time
you
sit
in
front
of
the
computer
ready
to
submit
your
class
selection
remember
you
only
go
to
vanderbilt
once
you
are
only
student
once
do
not
waste
the
opportunity
to
learn
something
totally
and
completely
out
of
your
comfort
zone
be
open
and
seek
out
the
random
with
regards
to
core
classes
advisers
can

prepare

read
on

insights
from
alumni

parents
that
are
taking

active

perhaps
these

can
help
guide
your
dialogue
when
speaking
to
your
student
or
other
students
at

about
this
topic
and
then
not
to
be
overlooked
we
will
also
reference
the
universitys
on

resources
as
you
speak
to

you
will

are
doing

some

thoughts
here
they
have
recruited
for

and
helped
some

attend

and
model

resources

since

maddie
has
remained
active
with
vanderbilt
in
several
ways
including
returning
to
campus
to
recruit
students
for
internship
and
full
time
opportunities
she
says
networking
is
crucial
piece
of
the
recruitment
puzzle
in
addition
to
the
many
events
hosted
by
the
career
center
maddie
highlighted
the
abundance
of
public
career
events
hosted
by
the
professional
societies
and
clubs
on
campus
often
these
events
have
been
coordinated
with
alumni
participants
who
come
to
campus
to
educate
and
scout
future
co
workers
maddie
highly
recommends
setting
up
handshake
and
maximizing
its
offerings
it
is
students
direct
access
to
recruiters
and
jobs
recruited
exclusively
at
campuses
when
leveraged
properly
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
tools
at
their
disposal
she
adds
another
tool
that
has
become
integral
for
new
job
seekers
is
linkedin
establishing
working
profile
on
linkedin
has
become
the
online
equivalent
of
posting
near
real
time
resume
in
many
industries
and
companies
linkedin
may
be
the
first
stop
for
hiring
managers
and
business
unit
heads
to
do
their
due
diligence
on
prospective
hires
lastly
she
recommends
students
being
themselves
during
the
process
ask
lots
of
questions
ask
peers
for
advice
do
lots
of
research
keep
an
open
mind

it
is
no

are
common
pathway
to

discussed
the

since
noting
the

the
improvements
taken

stressed
the
importance
of

helping

students
find
career
path
but
to
find
job
something
am
sure
all

can
appreciate
over
those
three

elevated
the
importance

and
aligned
its
operations
with
different

admissions
student
life

others

achieve
this
mission

another

not

broaden

to

as
spring
fever
takes

it
not
uncommon
for

to
think
others

doing

emotions
run

how
is

responding
to
this
phase
of

let
put
some
perspective
on
some
of
these
gnawing
emotions
its
march
poignant
time
for
seniors
as
they
begin
to
recognize

lasts

shift
their

life
after
vanderbilt
many
are
grappling
with
feelings
of
anxiety
heartbreak
and
fear
as
they
navigate
the
job
market
or
await
acceptance
into
graduate
programs
seeing
peers
celebrate
their
successes
can
exacerbate
these
emotions
leading
to
questions
of
why
they
havent
reached
the
same
milestones
meanwhile
sophomores
and
juniors
are
feeling
pressure
to
secure
summer
internships
which
can
add
to
the
sense
of
urgency
and
comparison
first
year
students
too
may
be
silently
struggling
with
imposter
syndrome
feeling
overwhelmed
by
academic
and
social
challenges
comparison
is
the
thief
of
all
joy
for
some
seniors
the
contrast
between
those
who
secured
job
offers
months
ago
and
those
still
searching
can
be
stark
amplifying
stress
levels
for
both
students
and
parents
however
our
role
is
to
provide
support
without
adding
to
their
stress
we
must
remind
themand
ourselvesnot
to
succumb
to
the
trap
of
comparison
and
to
trust
in
their

calmness

vanderbilt

with

tips
and
leads
on
job
hunting
and
internships
sophomores
and
juniors
driven
by
their
high
achieving
nature
are
actively
seeking
internships
its
true
that
the
journey
begins
early
typically
in
the
fall
semester
ultimately
its
all
about
networking
and
immersing
oneself
in
opportunities
it
involves
navigating
an
intricate
landscape
of
events
hosted
by
the
career
center
on
campus
company
information
sessions
professional
society
and
club
sponsored
public
events
and
utilizing
platforms
such
as
handshake
and
linkedin
furthermore
the
pervasive
habit
of
comparing
oneself
to
others
compounds
the
process
dont
get
too
worked
up
about
what
others
have
or
are
doing
encourage
your
student
to
remain
focused
on
their
own
path
and
timeline
first
year
students
and
students
at
all
levels
often
experience
imposter
syndrome
or
what
some
psychologists
call
duck
syndrome
this
refers
to
the
idea
that
individuals
may
appear
calm
and
composed
on
the
surface
much
like
duck
gliding
smoothly
on
water
but
underneath
they
are
paddling
furiously
to
keep
up
with
the
demands
and
pressures
they
face
its
important
to
recognize
that
theres
no
shame
in
admitting
this
and
seeking
help
as
parent
it
can
be
heart
wrenching
when
your
student
reaches
out
feeling
lost
and
struggling
to
find
their
place
whether
its
difficulty
forming
friendships
keeping
up
academically
or
facing
rejection
from
desired
club
or
organization
its
tough
to
witness
them
grappling
with
disappointment
and
self
doubt
rejection
especially
during
events
like
greek
rush
can
feel
deeply
personal
and
deliver
significant
blow
to
their
self
esteem
they
may
start
to
question
themselves
and
all
the
choices
they
have
made
in
these
moments
its
crucial
to
resist
the
urge
to
swoop
in
and
fix
everything
all
we
can
do
is
watch
and
encourage
from
the
sidelines
and
that
is
hard
we
want
to
see
them
hug
them
and
feed
them
instead
encourage
your
student
to
confront
their
challenges
head
on
while
it
may
be
tempting
to
visit
campus
frequently
or
bring
them
home
often
its
important
for
them
to
learn
to
navigate
these
difficulties
independently
and
utilize
the
resources
available
to
them
indeed
too
much
interference
can
suggest
we
dont
have
confidence
in
them
to
figure
it
out
for
themselves
and
could
contribute
to
feelings
of
inadequacy
encourage
them
to
immerse
themselves
in
social
activities
even
if
it
means
stepping
out
of
their
comfort
zone
and
trying
again
and
again
joining
clubs
and
organizations
can
provide
valuable
opportunities
for
connection

your

there
are
three
ways
to

first
do
it

move
it
all
back
home
by
driving
or
shipping
it
back
second
do
it
yourself
and
move
items
to
self

many
students
hire
rideshare
or
ask
friend
with

to
get
the
items
to
the
storage
unit
they
then
do
the
same
in

to
move
it
all
back
to
the

third
hire
movers
that
move
the
items
to
storage
in
may
and
back
in

if

do
the
third
option
recommend

care
for

here
are
few
things
to
keep
in
mind
for
parents
this
year
has
been
significant
transition
especially
for
freshmen
it
remarkable
how
quickly
time
fliesjust
nine
months
ago
you
wondered
how
your
student
would
fare
on
their
own
many
of
you
may
be
preoccupied
about
internships
jobs
and
graduate
schools
the
rigor
of
academics
and
social
involvement
is
still
taking
toll
as
they
end
the
semester
so
it
important
to
decompress
and
reflect
on
their
achievements
together
allow
them
to
share
their
thoughts
and
savor
them
point
out
the
glows
and
objectively
think
about
grows
are
there
any
lessons
learned
celebrate
what
they
are
proud
of
even
if
you
have
to
highlight
it
for
them
students
can
be
quite
humble
and
self
deprecating
regardless
of
where
you
are
in
this
journey
enjoy
some
well
deserved
time
off
with
your
students
there
will
be
opportunities
to
network
polish
off
that
resume
or
take
summer
class
but
block
off
some
time
in
the
calendar
where
conversations
about
college
or
life
after
college
dont
occur
dare
we
say
disconnect
from
vanderbilt
gasp
new
roles
and
responsibilities
can
wait
because
in
short
time
your
students
will
be
back
in
nashville
ready
to
dive
into
their
studies
and
when
that
time
comes
the
vanderbilt
community
will
be
there
to
encourage
support
and
challenge
them
