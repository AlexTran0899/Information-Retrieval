university
scientists
with
the
href
http://braingate.org/
brain
gate
research
consortium
have
developed
brain
computer
interface
that
translates
brain
signals
into
speech
with
up
to
97
accuracy
offering
significant
breakthrough
for
individuals
with
speech
impairments
due
to
conditions
like
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
the
technology
involves
using
implanted
sensors
in
the
brain
to
interpret
brain
signals
when
user
attempts
to
speak
these
signals
are
then
converted
into
text
which
is
read
aloud
by
computer
the
work
is
described
in
new
study
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
published
on
wednesday
aug
14
that
was
led
by
neurosurgeon
david
brandman
and
neuroscientist
sergey
stavisky
both
of
whom
are
brown
university
alumni
and
faculty
members
at
davis
health
our
technology
helped
man
with
paralysis
to
communicate
with
friends
families
and
caregivers
brandman
said
our
paper
demonstrates
the
most
accurate
speech
neuroprosthesis
ever
reported
also
known
as
lou
gehrig
disease
affects
nerve
cells
controlling
muscle
movement
leading
to
the
gradual
loss
of
mobility
and
speech
technology
aims
to
restore
communication
for
those
who
have
lost
the
ability
to
speak
due
to
paralysis
or
neurological
disorders
the
system
allowed
casey
harrell
45
year
old
person
with
to
communicate
his
intended
speech
effectively
within
minutes
of
activation
the
powerful
moment
brought
tears
to
harrell
and
his
family
harrell
reflecting
on
his
experience
with
the
technology
described
the
impact
that
regaining
the
ability
to
communicate
could
have
on
others
facing
similar
challenges
not
being
able
to
communicate
is
so
frustrating
and
demoralizing
it
is
like
you
are
trapped
harrell
said
something
like
this
technology
will
help
people
back
into

hochberg

they

tremendous
credit
for
joining

they
do
this
not
because
theyre
hoping
to
gain
any
personal
benefit

to

stavisky
said
we

basically
listening
into
