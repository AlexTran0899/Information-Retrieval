the

forced

to
ask

profound
questions
about

how
does
this
impact

king
said
how
does
this
help
me
serve
those
who
are
the
most
marginalized

how
has
this

to
be
able

reach

experience

these

the
pilgrimage
group
at
the
monument
of
independence
in
mexico
city
alvarez
was
born
in
mexico
but
went
with
his
family
to
work
as
migrant
field
workers
in
america
every
summer
until
he
was
5
when
they
settled
in
colorado
he
got
his
undergraduate
degree
in
theology
at
notre
dame
in
and
worked
in
catholic
high
schools
and
parishes
in
chicago
but
he
returned
for
his
master
in
divinity
to
get
more
formation
in
his
vocational
call
to
serve
low
income
latino
families
where
he
saw
extraordinary
need
he
helped
plan
the
pilgrimage
to
mexico
and
said
he
appreciated
the
enthusiasm
his
fellow
students
displayed
ive
seen
instances
in
the
catholic
church
where
cultural
sensitivity
or
competence
or
familiarity
could
have
been
lot
better
alvarez
said
for
me
it
means
lot
when
someone
whos
not
latino
is
taking
an
interest
in
the
culture
and
getting
the
background
to
be
able
to
then
go
into
ministry
and
accompany
people
little
bit
of
interest
goes
long
way
so
to
see
my
classmates
trying
spanish
even
speaking
poorly
we
welcome
all
that
walatka
said
the
notre

masters
program
in

integrates

unique
component
of

is
training

students

seminarians
together
both
in

the

grew
up
in

family
near

with
two
parents
who
are

in

as

to
prepare
for
the
href

seminary
graduating
in
he
said
forming
deep
relationships
with
lay
classmates
will
make
him
better
priest
and
person
to
be
able
to
have
people
can
go
to
who
know
me
and
who
know
what
ministry
is
as
well
to
ask
them
what
they
think
but
also
to
have
wide
range
of
perspectives
ndash
thats
really
important
ryan
said
in
very
simple
way
the
majority
of
the
church
are
not
priests
and
we
cant
be
separate
ryan
said
he
fell
in
love
with
the
family
business
of
teaching
when
he
taught
fifth
grade
this
summer
and
the
mexico
pilgrimage
provided
an
opportunity
to
embrace
the
whole
person
included
in
that
is
someones
culture
because
you
cant
really
have
person
outside
culture
he
said
theres
way
in
which
the
gospel
can
speak
to
each
culture
not
necessarily
that
were
changing
the
gospel
but
emphasizing
how
are
we
going
to
color
the
gospel
in
such
way
that
it
speaks
to
people
king
who
is
an
assistant
rector
in
ryan
hall
grew
up
in
texas
with
mexican
american
mother
and
irish
german
father
ndash
between
both
cultures
but
anchored
in
the
catholic
church
she
began
as
finance
major
at
university
of
the
incarnate
word
but
switched
to
theology
after
getting
involved
in
campus
ministry
king
will
work
as
director
of
youth
ministry
at
st
adalberts
after
she
graduates
she
agreed
with
ryan
that
undergoing
formation
with
future
priests
was
crucial
especially
because
female
perspective
is
needed
have
classmate
that
just
did
her
final
presentation
on
breastfeeding
and
pregnancy
and
theology
and
know
for
the
seminarians
they
were
like
wow
these
are
just
things
never
considered
before
king
did
an
immersion
program
over
the
summer
at
href
https://catholiccharitiesrgv.org/about-us/
catholic
charities
in
brownsville
texas
near
the
mexican
border
even
though
she
grew
up
in
mexican
american
family
she
said
the
cultural
competency
training
was
valuable
because
she
had
never
confronted
migrants
before
was
able
to
encounter
the
deep
faith
that
people
have
king
said
theyre
displaced
they
literally
showed
up
without
shoelaces
we
were
able
to
meet
material
needs
but
also
provide
some
sort
of
spiritual
nourishment
just
witnessing
the
hope
that
people
have
that
god
has
plan
for
their
lives
and
thats
carried
them
this
far
ndash
it
was
transformative
and
dont
think
my
heart
will
ever
be
the
same
after
encountering
physical
people
in
the
midst
of
their
suffering
