audience
members
included
exploring
internships
visiting
faculty
programs
and
joint

the
themes
for

were
chosen
not
only
because
they
are
major
areas
of

excellence
at

but
also
because
they
are
important
challenges
to
address
in

said
tejal
desai
dean
of
browns
school
of
engineering
as
community
we
approach
these
topics
and
areas
from
number
of
different
perspectives
and
we
think
that
by
bringing
together
our
expertise
and
really
collaborating
with
the
es
labs
across
the
nation
we
can
amplify
our
impact
in
ways
that
previously
haven
been
done
and
make
those
leaps
to
uncover
new
discoveries
that
are
able
to
translate
into
real

17
national

are
an
outgrowth
of
immense
investment
in
scientific
research
initiated
by
the
government
during
world
war
for
more
than
70
years
the
labs
have
been
at
the
forefront
of
scientific
innovation
in
the
confronting
some
of
the
most
critical
scientific
challenges
facing
the
nation
and
the
world
from
combating
climate
change
to
studying
the
origins
of
the
universe
or
how
atoms
work
at
their
smallest
levels
throughout
that
history
collaboration
with
research
institutions
like
brown
has
been
essential
to
their
continued
success
thats
no
different
today
from
the
laboratories
point
of
view
collaborations
with
universities
including
the
many
collaborations
with
brown
researchers
are
important
to
delivering
world
class
research
and
strengthening
overall
contribution
to
the
nations
research
enterprise
pipher
said
events
