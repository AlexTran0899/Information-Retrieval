princeton
catalysis
initiative
hosted
its
sixth
annual
symposium
this
year
with
research
flash
talks
that
drew
princeton
faculty
from
variety
of
fields
as
presenters
and
audience
members
and
attracted
industry
attention
the
annual
symposium
challenges
speakers
to
tell
their
best
research
stories
in
under
eight
minutes
spotlighting
blue
sky
ideas
to
catalyze
fresh
collaborations
this
years
presenters
included
faculty
in
sociology
music
and
princetons
school
of
public
and
international
affairs
along
with
representatives
from
disciplines
that
have
been
part
of
since
its
inception
computer
science
molecular
biology
engineering
chemistry
and
genomics
catalysis
beyond
chemistry
in
david
mac
millan
the
james
mc
donnell
distinguished
university
professor
of
chemistry
and
several
colleagues
founded
as
way
to
catalyze
new
research
partnerships
on
campus
and
with
industry
today
collaborations
across
12
departments
are
backed
by
million
in
committed
funding
the
idea
was
if
you
think
of
all
the
cutting
edge
research
going
on
in
all
these
departments
and
you
could
connect
them
at
the
intersections
could
you
create
new
research
fields
mac
millan
said
in
his
opening
remarks
at
this
years
event
held
at
the
end
of
the
academic
year
in
frick
laboratory
and
could
you
do
that
not
just
once
but
as
routine
mechanism
thats
what
we
call
href
https://research.princeton.edu/news/catalysis-beyond-chemistry-researchers-gather-spark-new-research-ideas
catalysis
beyond
chemistry
thats
why
were
here
today
faculty
presenters
laid
out
their
work
in
four
sessions
with
topics
ranging
from
quantum
engineering
to
human
centered
decarbonization
strategies
to
the
regulation
of
microbial
proteins
across
the
day
night
cycle
afterwards
they
fielded
questions
from
peers
and
representatives
of
is
six
industry
partners
so
nascent
so
cutting
edge
the
research
is
always
so
nascent
so
cutting
edge
and
they
link
it
in
such
way
that
you
can
make
the
next
jump
said
callie
bryan
cientific
director
at
janssen
johnson
amp
johnson
who
has
attended
symposia
for
several
years
youre
listening
to
fascinating
researchers
all
day
she
said
when
they
jump
from
topic
to
topic
and
they
riff
on
each
other
you
get
all
of
these
ideas
put
them
together
and
thats
when
you
get
the
lightbulbs
lydia
lynch
professor
of
molecular
biology
and
the
ludwig
princeton
branch
was
attending
and
presenting
for
the
first
time
for
me
being
new
this
was
great
way
to
get
snapshot
of
the
exciting
work
going
on
in
princeton
she
said
have
seen
flash
talks
before
but
these
were
different
learned
so
much
wide
ranging
discussing
afterwards
connected
colleagues
from
across
the
university
had
talk
with
climate
scientist
who
asked
an
immunology
question
lynch
said
this
years
presenters
included
elizabeth

music
and
director

daydreams
as
precursors

insight
