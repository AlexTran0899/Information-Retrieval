emens
said
those
are
the
things
you
want
to
explain
in
your
application
wanted
admission

to
see
the
real
me
and
what
im
passionate
about
students

more
about
the
transfer
application
process
during

appreciate
that

attentive
to
their
mental
and
emotional
well

deal
of
energy
into
building
welcoming
community
shaw
said
taking
two
ivy
league
courses
at
double
speed
in
the
summer

is
no
joke
but
the
students
are
also
having
fun
both
through
our
larger
gatherings
like
the
grounds
for
sculpture
trip
and
through
the
friendships
and
smaller
communities
theyve
built
for
themselves

county
community
college
was
among

will
last
beyond

an

on

gordin
discussed
his

on

fringe
where
science
meets
pseudoscience
it
is
really
hard
problem
to
decide
what
counts
as
science
and
what
counts
as
pseudoscience
he
said
understanding
why
its
hard
is
an
interesting
tour
of
multiple

the

the

philosophy
nbsp
these
questions
can
also
apply

he
noted
the

of

is
about
distinguishing

that
is
why
you

kim

the

you

realistic

we

we
