welcome
maryland
is
wonderful
and
diverse
community
diversity
is
one
of
our
core
values
and
our
campus
is
strengthened
and
enriched
by
people
with
disabilities
accessibility
is
an
approach
to
communication
and
engagement
that
recognizes
the
intersectional
identities
experiences
and
needs
of
our
entire
campus
community
it
goes
beyond
legal
accommodations
for
students
staff
and
faculty
with
disabilities
we
work
towards
making
this
community
where
we
each
can
bring
our
whole
self
to
campus
where
we
each
have
the
opportunity
to
thrive
we
do
this
in
three
main
ways
1
by
working
towards
building
strong
community
of
people
with
disabilities
on
our
campus
2
by
interrupting
structural
attitudinal
and
institutional
barriers
that
hinder
equal
access
to
university
sponsored
programs
and
activities
3
by
being
community
that
values
all
persons
with
disabilities
as
integral
members
of
our
campus
community
