studio
in
addition
to
creating
her
own
ar
work
she
represents
other
ar
artists
but
her
primary
focus
with
kaleida
is
creating
nonfiction
animation
for
documentary
films
and
series
she
keeps
her
finger
on
the
pulse
of
the
latest
tech
shes
begun
exploring
how
to
use
artificial
intelligence
as
tool
in
her
work
morrison
and
gratz
started
out
on
more
traditional
paths
at
cfa
but
both
have
always
harbored
spirit
of
innovation
morrison
was
an
acting
student
but
later
chose
to
pursue
an
independent
theater
studies
track
to
explore
all
of
his
interests
coming
from
martial
arts
background
he
was
especially
interested
in
physical
work
and
stage
combat
was
able
to
cobble
together
this
weird
sort
of
movement
for
the
stage
bfa
program
he
says
was
able
to
pursue
all
the
movement
acting
directing
and
fight
stuff
that
wanted
to
it
definitely
set
me
on
path
of
learning
everything
gratz
was
graphic
design
major
but
was
drawn
to
animation
through
multimedia
class
she
took
we
did
one
or
two
little
animation
projects
in
adobe
flash
she
recalls
my
brain
clicked
lot
better
with
designing
with
motion
and
time
than
it
did
with
static
graphic
design
pieces
think
where
that
comes
from
is
have
whole
background
with
dance
and
performances
and
musicals
so
to
me
animation
was
like
oh
my
god
im
choreographing
my
artwork
it
can
be
to
music
it
can
have
rhythm
was
immediately
like
oh
wow
this
is
what
need
to
do
hr
started
to
consider
vr
as
an
artistic
enterprise
and
the
very
first
thing
thought
of
was
everybody
wants
to
be
werewolf
br
christopher
morrison
hr
in
the
spirit
of
their
boundary
pushing
ethos
both
have
embraced
new
formats
and
technologies
to
express
their
creativity
throughout
their
careers
they
are
now
doing
so
at
time
of
rapid
advancements
and
when
more
questions
around
ethical
issues
of
technology
especially
ai
are
arising
some
question
whether
purely
ai
generated
imagery
is
art
and
many
artists
are
concerned
that
generative
ai
art
programs
could
be
drawing
from
copyrighted
content
morrison
and
gratz
are
aware
of
these
issues
but
are
also
intrigued
by
the
constant
developments
in
the
technology
just
consider
myself
as
someone
with
some
experience
in
the
vr
industry
as
it
sits
right
now
says
morrison
these
days
everythings
in
flux
the
tech
seems
to
change
almost
weekly
and
thats
also
one
of
the
reasons
its
very
exciting
why
vr
if
it
seems
unusual
that
more
artists
are
integrating
technologies
like
virtual
reality
into
their
work
consider
the
words
of
jaron
lanier
pioneer
in
the
field
vr
can
be
way
of
exploring
the
nature
of
consciousness
relationships
bodies
and
perception
in
other
words
it
can
be
art
vr
is
most
fun
when
approached
that
way
lanier
writes
in
the
new
yorker
article
where
will
virtual
reality
take
us
he
later
adds
ive
always
thought
that
vr
sessions
make
the
most
sense
either
when
they
accomplish
something
specific
and
practical
that
doesnt
take
very
long
or
when
they
are
as
weird
as
possible
morrison
seems
to
have
taken
laniers
view
to
heart
all
of
his
creative
pursuitsincluding
his
foray
into
vrstem
from
his
love
of
role
playing
games
like
dungeons
amp
dragons
which
he
enjoyed
for
allowing
him
to
develop
characters
and
explore
their
relationships
to
each
other
sitting
around
table
improvising
story
with
group
of
people
is
still
at
the
core
of
what
do
morrison
says
hr
have
business
cards
that
are
ar
if
you
activate
them
the
animation
side
still
blows
everyones
minds
and
gives
people
lot
of
joy
br
julie
gratz
hr
as
for
laniers
point
about
doing
something
specific
and
practical
and
embracing
the
weird
morrison
did
just
that
in
the
werewolf
experience
which
he
worked
on
mostly
over
the
course
of
covid
lockdowns
he
came
up
with
the
script
for
the
story
and
then
partnered
with
the
pack
studio
belgium
based
visual
effects
company
to
produce
the
animated
vr
short
since
its
completion
in
the
werewolf
experience
has
been
in
festivals
around
the
worldit
was
one
of
three
vr
pieces
to
be
featured
at
the
cannes
film
festivaland
morrison
is
also
working
to
release
it
for
download
on
the
gaming
platform
steam
with
the
werewolf
experience
morrison
was
trying
to
address
something
hed
long
thought
about
when
it
came
to
traditional
video
games
one
of
the
things
that
always
bothered
me
was
that
we
would
have
the
same
controller
for
every
game
he
says
know
lot
of
people
would
say
of
course
its
the
only
way
to
do
it
but
ive
thought
about
what
if
there
were
different
controller
for
every
game
we
made
it
would
give
you
different
interaction
think
the
controller
becomes
trap
narratively
and
mechanic
wise
youre
stuck
in
this
box
with
vr
its
worse
because
the
controllers
are
even
more
simplified
then
morrison
started
thinking
what
if
he
eliminated
the
need
for
controllers
entirely
you
have
new
body
and
youre
in
new
world
but
if
youre
needing
to
use
the
thumbsticks
on
controllers
youre
holding
youre
in
two
places
at
once
so
the
mechanic
that
wanted
to
deal
with
was
that
you
control
everything
with
your
voice
and
since
you
are
werewolf
that
means
you
howl
at
key
moments
throughout
the
story
whether
you
choose
to
howl
or
stay
silent
affects
what
happens
next
there
are
three
different
endings
depending
on
the
decisions
you
make
throughout
the
game
while
variations
of
vr
have
been
around
for
many
decades
the
technology
has
quickly
advanced
in
recent
years
it
started
to
become
mainstream
in
the
mid
when
companies
like
meta
htc
and
sony
began
selling
headsets
with
high
quality
graphics
to
use
at
home
mainly
for
gaming
in
february
apple
got
into
the
vr
mix
with
its
apple
vision
pro
headset
today
vr
is
being
used
in
multitude
of
ways
in
many
fields
including
education
retail
and
healthcare
the
technology
may
be
more
widely
accessible
morrison
says
but
people
are
still
figuring
out
its
best
applications
it
requires
careful
thought
about
what
content
is
best
served
by
the
technology
if
youre
doing
vr
thing
he
says
it
has
to
have
some
kind
of
mechanic
at
its
core
that
takes
advantage
of
virtual
reality
otherwise
why
do
it
in
vr
people
just
throw
stories
at
it
that
dont
make
any
sense
for
the
technology
while
companies
like
apple
and
meta
continue
to
invest
in
vr
all
is
not
well
in
the
industry
cnbc
reported
last
december
that
sales
of
vr
headsets
in
decreased
by
nearly
40
percent
morrison
acknowledges
the
volatility
of
the
industry
but
he
is
hopeful
about
its
future
vr
has
been
declared
dead
maybe
six
different
times
ever
since
it
was
introduced
in
the
90
sreally
in
the
if
you
want
to
get
specific
but
im
talking
since
the
90
when
the
potential
really
arrived
he
says
most
people
consider
as
year
zero
of
vr
as
it
is
today
when
the
first
generation
of
the
oculus
rift
dropped
even
from
then
its
been
declared
dead
twice
were
in
weird
valley
right
now
but
personally
think
it
will
come
back
and
im
excited
animation
of
the
future
like
morrison
gratz
is
attuned
to
the
constant
flux
of
technology
back
in
she
was
living
in
brooklyn
and
sharing
studio
building
with
tech
production
company
they
encouraged
her
to
try
working
with
ar
at
the
time
was
like
dont
understand
ar
that
sounds
crazy
she
says
but
realized
that
with
ar
the
hardest
part
is
what
happens
when
it
is
activatedthe
animation
itself
and
already
had
experience
with
that
she
made
some
new
animations
and
created
prints
from
themits
basically
printing
out
one
frame
of
the
animation
she
saysthen
connected
the
prints
to
an
ar
app
called
artivive
she
hosted
an
open
studio
event
to
show
off
the
interactive
work
and
was
thrilled
with
the
reaction
it
blew
everyones
minds
it
was
really
satisfying
and
fun

how

she
had

for

shes
still

soon
have
been
making

that
havent

she
says
my
goal
is
to
continue
the

with
things
that
are
not
only
these
gallery
quality

that
people
can
buy

also
much
more

options
for

have

had
two

singing

sheet
rather
than
just
fading
from

able

track
the
differences

of
the

in

to

it

it

she

still

some
people
are

dont

says

keeping

its
been
more
of
tool
for
me
and
if
anything
has
made
my
job
faster
which
has
actually
been
helpful
would
encourage
artists
to
not
be
afraid
of
technology
and
also
to
not
think
that
its
out
of
their
realm
of
expertise
there
are
so
many
ways

can
use
