Traditions</h1
we're
proud
of
our
many
fun
and
unique
traditions
at
the
university
of
arkansas
here
are
just
few
of
the
traditions
that
have
shaped
the
of
's
distinct
identity
and
have
united
generations
of
students.</p
there
are
dozens
of
lions
tigers
and
bears
but
in
all
of
college
athletics
there
is
only
one
razorback
but
it
was
n't
always
that
way
the
university
's
teams
were
known
as
the
cardinals
until
arkansas
football
coach
hugo
bezdek
fatefully
called
his
players
wild
band
of
razorback
hogs
after
big
win
over
lsu
in
1909.</p
the
razorback
characterized
by
ridge
back
and
its
tenacious
wild
fighting
ability
immediately
became
popular
nickname
and
one
year
after
coach
bezdek
's
statement
the
student
body
voted
to
change
the
official
mascot
to
razorbacks.</p
tusk
the
live
mascot
that
represents
the
razorbacks
today
is
no
barnyard
pig
tusk
vi
is
russian
boar
which
closely
resembles
the
wild
hogs
known
as
razorbacks
native
to
the
arkansas
wilderness
these
razorbacks
are
tough
and
at
times
ill
tempered
animals
whose
fearlessness
and
doggedness
were
the
inspiration
for
the
razorback
nickname.</p
the
tradition
of
having
live
razorback
mascot
attending
football
games
and
other
events
has
been
fan
favorite
since
the
university
's
first
hooved
beast
made
its
debut
in
the
1960s.</p
hogs
through
the
years
calling
the
hogs
raise
your
arms
above
your
head
during
the
the
hog
call
yell
wooo
and
wiggle
your
fingers
for
few
seconds.</li
next
bring
both
arms
straight
down
with
fists
clinched
while
yelling
pig
"</li
then
extend
your
right
arm
with
the
sooie
"</li
repeat
these
steps
two
more
times
and
finish
by
