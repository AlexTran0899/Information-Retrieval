as
threefold
from
punitive
standpoint
he
said
they

these

from
opportunities
that

have

send

ldquo;it
is
symbolically
important
that
the

recognizes
that
these
people
need
to
be
sanctioned,&rdquo
he
said

it
sends
signal
to

government
that
they
need

take

seriously.&rdquo;</p

this

made
the
most
of

disciplinary

generally
speaking
students
who
participate
in
the
magnitsky
clinic
work
as
team
to
request
sanctions
against
an
individual
or
entity
that
has
engaged
in
ldquo;serious
human
rights
abuses&rdquo
or
ldquo;significant
acts
of
corruption&rdquo
in
violation
of
u.s.
laws
or
policy
this
involves
meticulous
research
of
public
records
and
investigations
as
well
as
other
publicly
available
documents
students
rely
heavily
on
the
work
of
the
international

of
investigative
journalists
which
published

greg
miller
senior
honors
economics
major
from
chandler
arizona
knows
just
how
difficult
the
process
can
be
former
rhodes
finalist
miller
contributed
to
both
the
mizzi
schembri
and
dos
santos
dossiers
first
as
magnitsky
student
and
later
with
the
student
policy
network
which
he
cofounded
with
senior
political
science
honors
major
patrick
aimone
fellow
magnitsky
student
and
rhodes
finalist
and
his
roommate
in
the
washington
program.</p
with
respect
to
the
galizia
case
miller
who
is
primarily
interested
in
housing
policy
and
may
go
to
law
school
said
ldquo;i
mostly
worked
on
forming
the
timeline
of
everything
that
occurred
to
visualize
how
the
corruption
took
place
particularly
in
relation
to
the
timeline
of
the
killing
of
galizia
also
created
diagrams
to
figure
out
how
each
shell
company
related
to
the
next
and
who
was
paying
who
and
who
was
getting
kickbacks.&rdquo;</p
headshot
of
greg
miller
he
did
the

with
the
dos
santos
case
he
said
working
closely
with
others
in
the
student
policy
network
as
well
as
human
rights
lawyers
to
document
her
alleged
crimes
and
push
for
sanctions
against
her
and
her
husband.</p
from
the
perspective
of
someone
interested
in
both
public
policy
and
the
law
and
simply
as
an
introduction
to
the
magnitsky
act
and
the
complicated
world
of
international
sanctions
it
was
valuable
experience
miller
said.</p
he
said
he
was
sitting
in
his
apartment
eating
goldfish
when
news
of
the
sanctions
came
down
ldquo;it
was
crazy,&rdquo
he
said
ldquo;i&rsquo;m
college
student
eating
goldfish
and
there&rsquo;s
this
international
story
that
i&rsquo;m
involved
with.&rdquo;</p
in
addition
to
sanctions
work
including
two
pending
sanctions
requests
the
student
policy
network
pursues
other
public
policy
research
and
advocacy
projects
as
well
recently
it
published
study
examining
the
social
and
economic
benefits
of
driving
cards
for
undocumented
residents
in
indiana
which
is
helping
to
inform
debate
around
the
issue
in
the
state
general
assembly.</p
kellenberg
for
his
part
praised
the
student
policy
network
mdash
and
miller
specifically
mdash
for
its
work
on
the
dos
santos
case
calling
it
ldquo;excellent.&rdquo;</p
he
added
ldquo;i
have
the
utmost
respect
for
greg
and
patrick
and
the
work
that
they
are
doing
and
hope
that
it
continues.&rdquo;</p
miller
expects
that
it
will
he
pointed
to
ongoing
interest
in
the
organization
as
well
as
its
mission
among
students
of
all
ages.</p
