what&rsquo;s
going
on
in
your
head
while
you
sleep
the
research
of
associate
professor
and
nancy
o&rsquo;neill
collegiate
chair
in
psychology
shows
that
the
non
waking
hours
are
incredibly
valuable
for
your
day
to
day
especially
for
helping
to
commit
information
to
memory
and
for
problem

if
you
ever
thought
sleep
was
just
downtime

one
task
and

many
regions
of
the
brain
especially
those
involved
in
learning
processing
information
and
emotion
are
actually
more
active
during

than
when

these

payne&rsquo;s
research
has
focused
on
what
types
of
information
are
submitted
to

has
been
instrumental
in
better
understanding
how

it&rsquo;s
not
just
advice
for
toddlers
payne&rsquo;s
research
indicates
all
of
us
could
benefit
if
we
took
nap
each
day
the
trick
is
keeping
your
naps
brief
enough
or
long
enough
so
that
you
don&rsquo;t
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
sleep
cycle

feel
groggy

fatigued
after
whatever
the
duration
payne&rsquo;s
data
suggests
we
never
should&rsquo;ve
left
daytime

it&rsquo;s
often
on
our
weekend
to
do
list
catching
up
on
sleep
has
been
favorite
pastime
for
most
of
us
since
we
were
teenagers
but
as

points
out
there&rsquo;s

how

can

adults
are
typically
told
they
need
about
eight
hours
of
sleep
each
night
while
the
majority
of
us
do
need
between
seven
and
nine
hours
payne
points
out
that
the
amount
of
sleep
needed
by
adults
is
normally
distributed
meaning
that
while
rare
there
are
those
among
us
who
do
just
fine
on
four
or
five
hours
and
some
who
need
more
than
nine.</p
the
bad
news
of
course
is
that
most
of
us
do
not
get
the
sleep
we
need
the
good
news
payne
explains
that
just
more
minutes
of
shuteye
on
regular
basis
will
help
you
begin
to
reap
the
brain
building
benefits
of
sleep.</p
