said
when
she
first
heard
about
pep
she
was
skeptical
researching
the
mission
and
structure
of
the
program
was
encouraging
but
she
was
nt
fully
convinced
until
she
attended
an
in
person
information
session.</span></p><p><span
all
the
students
and
professors
were
very
excited
about
the
program
and
very
willing
to
try
something
this
unique
and
different
chandler
said
thought
with
group
of
people
who
wanted
to
do
this
as
badly
as
everyone
did
and
me
wanting
to
do
it
but
just
being
little
bit
nervous
it
made
no
sense
for
me
not
to
give
it
shot.</span></p><p><span
chandlers
nerves
were
dispelled
on
the
first
day
of
class
when
she
and
an
inside
student
discovered
that
they
both
love
the
singer
lauryn
hill
for
her
this
connection
helped
break
down
an
invisible
barrier.</span></p><p><span
we
really
do
nt
communicate
across
lines
of
difference
chandler
said
programs
like
pep
help
us
root
our
ideas
of
difference
in
real
lived
experience.</span></p><p><span
vaun
moser
sophomore

carnegie
mellon

it
really
helps
you
with
breaking
down
stereotypes
you
may
have
not

known

you
had
she
said.</span></p><p><span
moser
added
that
her
classroom
experience
in

was
uniquely
supportive.</span></p><p><span
one
of
the
first
days
when
we
were
all
in
circle
having
discussion
about
the
reading
shared
my
opinion
on
something
and
one
of
the
inside
students
next
to
me
was
like
oh
really
like
that
good
job
and
ever
since
then
we
ve
all
just
started
encouraging
each
other
after
sharing
our
opinion

at

somerset
sign
pep
is
also
an
exciting
opportunity
for
the
inside
students
when
the
courses
were
first
announced
nearly
people
applied
to
take
them.</span></p><p><span
for
the
incarcerated
students
think
its
chance
to
access
education
in
way
that
is
often
denied
to
lots
of
parts
of
society
manke
miller
said
and
not
just
access
but
the
experience
of
being
able
to
interact
with
the
course
material
and
think
oh
have
complicated
thoughts
about
the
world
as
well
and
they
re
represented
in
some
of
the
things
reading
about.</span></p><p><span
this
excitement
is
reflected
in
the
quality
of
the
inside
students
work.</span></p><p><span
the
class
has
been
one
of
the
most
interesting
classes
have
ever
taught
in
over
years
goldman
said
the
inside
students
engage
with
the
material
in
way
that
is
an
absolute
joy
to
professor.</span></p><p><span
goldman
pointed
out
many
of
the
inside
students
went
to
prison
in
their
late
teens
or
early
twenties
the
same
age
the
cmu
students
are
now
and
have
been
incarcerated
for
upwards
of
two
decades
for
these
students
the
opportunity
to
take
college
courses
is
especially
meaningful.</span></p><p><span
brandon
an
sci
somerset
student
said
of
pep
can
not
begin
to
express
how
much
it
was
appreciated
always
looked
forward
to
fridays
not
because
was
getting
off
the
housing
unit
or
going
to
school
but
mainly
because
the
professor
and
the
cmu
students
treated
me
and
the
other
inmates
like
real
people.</span></p><p><span
as
the
spring
term
drew
to
close
goldman
and
manke
miller
felt
it
was
important
to
acknowledge
the
students
hard
work
and
dedication
on
the
last
day
of
class
the
inside
and
outside
students
received
certificates
at
special
ceremony
attended
by
dietrich
colleges
dean.</span></p><p><span
the
experience
of
watching
equal
numbers
of
cmu
students
and
somerset
prison
students
get
certificates
was
deeply
gratifying
scheines
said
students
were
transformed
and
said
so
ve
been
in

education
for
years
and
ve
never
seen
anything
