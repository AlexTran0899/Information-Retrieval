aug
while
the
u.s.
federal
government
has
clean
energy
targets
they
are
not
binding
most
economically
developed
countries
have
mandatory
policies
designed
to
bolster
renewable
electricity
production
because
the
u.s.
lacks
an
enforceable
federal
mandate
for
renewable
electricity
individual
states
are
left
to
develop
their
own
regulations.&nbsp;</p

an
assistant
professor
at
purdue
university
and
georgia
tech
ph.d.
alumna
and
barry
solomon
professor
emeritus
of
environmental
policy
at
michigan
technological
university
investigated
how
clean
electricity
policies
affect
not
only
the
states
that
adopt
them
but
neighboring
states
as
well
using
data
driven
comparisons
the
researchers
found
that
the
impact
of
these
subnational
clean
energy
policies
is
far
greater
and
more
nuanced
than
previously
known.&nbsp;</p
their
research
was
recently
in
the
journal
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences</em>.&nbsp;</p
analysts
are
asking
if
the
u.s.
should
have
federal
renewable
mandate
to
put
the
whole
country
on
the
same
page
or
if
individual
state
policies
are
sufficient
brown
said
to
answer
that
question
it
is
useful
to
know
if
states
with
renewable
energy
policies
are
influencing
those
without
them.</p
brown
solomon
and
zhou
examined
common
clean
energy
policy
tool
the
renewable
portfolio
standard
rps
adopted
by
more
than
half
of
u.s.
states
rpss
are
regulations
requiring
states
utility
providers
to
generate
certain
percentage
of
their
electricity
from
renewable
resources
such
as
wind
or
solar
many
of
these
standards
are
mandatory
with
utility
companies
facing
fines
if
they
fail
to
reach
targets
within
given
time.</p
to
investigate
the
influence
of
these
policies
across
state
lines
the
researchers
first
created
dataset
that
included
years
of
annual
renewable
electricity
generation
data
for
u.s.
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
they
then
used
the
dataset
to
generate
pairs
of
states
linking
each
state
to
its
geographic
neighbors
or
electricity
trading
partners
allowing
them
to
examine
the
influence
of
the
rps
policy
adopted
by
one
of
the
pair
on
the
renewable
energy
generation
of
the
other
total
of
1,519
paired
comparisons.&nbsp;</p
by
only
looking
at
the
pairs
we
can
see
if
an
rps
in
one
state
directly
affects
renewable
electricity
generation
in
another
state
and
if
that
the
case
whether
it
is
because
they
are
geographic
neighbors
or
if
its
because
they
are
participating
in
the
same
wholesale
electricity
market
zhou
said.&nbsp;</p
looking
into
the
electricity
market
is
important
because
states
often
purchase
electricity
from
other
states
through
wholesale
markets
rather
than
exclusively
producing
their
own
power
and
the
purchased
power
can
be
generated
from
renewables
utilities
in
some
states
may
be
allowed
to
meet
their
own
rps
requirements
by
purchasing
renewable
energy
credits
based
on
the
renewable
electricity
generated
in
other
states.&nbsp;</p
in
their
analyses
the
team
also
considered
the
concept
of
policy
stringency
stringency
measure
evaluates
states
renewable
electricity
targets
relative
to
the
amount
currently
produced
in
the
state
for
example
if
state
requires
electric
utilities
to
generate
of
their
electricity
from
renewable
sources
by
and
the
state
already
has
it
is
nt
very
stringent
policy
on
the
other
hand
if
state
has
target
and
only
uses
renewables
currently
it
has
more
ambitious
and
stringent
rps.</p
though
policy
experts
have
used
the
metric
in
related
work
for
over
decade
the
research
team
improved
the
design.&nbsp;</p
our
stringency
variable
includes
interim
targets
as
well
as
the
existing
share
of
renewable
energy
generation
solomon
said.</p
the
team
found
that
the
amount
of
renewable
electricity
generation
in
state
is
not
only
influenced
by
whether
that
state
has
its
own
rps
but
also
by
the
rps
policies
of
neighboring
states.&nbsp;</p
we
also
learned
that
the
stronger
neighboring
states
rps
policy
is
the
more
likely
given
state
is
to
generate
more
renewable
electricity
brown
said
its
all
very
interactive
web
with
many
co
benefits.</p
the
authors
were
surprised
to
find
that
given
states
electricity
trading
partners
did
not
hold
the
most
influence
over
renewable
generation
but
rather
the
geographical
proximity
to
rps
states
they
suggest
that
past
rps
policy
research
focusing
on
within
state
impacts
likely
underestimated
an
rpss
full
impact.&nbsp;while
the
researchers
have
not
yet
identified
all
factors
that
can
cause
spillover
effects
they
plan
to
investigate
this
further.&nbsp;</p
the
spillover
effect
is
very
significant
and
should
not
be
overlooked
by
future
research
especially
for
states
without
rpss
zhou
said
for
states
without
policies
their
renewable
electricity
generation
is
very
heavily
influenced
by
their
neighbors.</p
