parenting
style
helicopter
parenting
disciplinarian
versus
free
range
explorer
nurturing
may
be
key
to
the
country
's
political
future
new
study
out
of
carnegie
mellon
university
has
found
person
's
parenting
style
tips
their
hand
to
the
adoption
of
future
government
policies
across
wide
range
of
social
issues
including
education
elder
care
and
medicine
the
results
are
available
in
the
june
issue
of
the
professor
of
social
and
decision
sciences
in
the
and
contributing
author
on
the
paper
quot;if
the
helicopter
parenting
trend
continues
we
can
expect
people
to
endorse
greater
intervention
in
personal
liberty
in
most
social
institutions.&quot;</p><p
oppenheimer
based
his
study
on
previous
work
by
george
philip
lakoff
who
examined
quot;government
as
family&quot
theory
this
approach
suggests
that
person
's
belief
on
how
government
should
function
is
strongly
correlated
to
their
personal
belief
on
how
families
should
function
in
the
united
states
this
concept
translates
into
two
approaches
conservatives
lean
toward
the
moral
quot;strict
father&quot
model
and
liberals
lean
toward
the
quot;nurturing
parent&quot
model.</p><p
in
this
work
oppenheimer
and
his
colleague
christian
lindke
focused
on
the
concept
of
the
helicopter
parent
which
has
been
defined
as
quot;a
parent
who
takes
an
overprotective
or
excessive
interest
in
the
life
of
their
child
or
children.&quot
free
range
parenting
falls
on
the
opposite
extreme
to
this
parenting
style
the
team
conducted
three
studies
to
evaluate
the
role
of
parenting
style
on
policy
implications.</p

in
the
first
study
the
researchers
asked
participants
nearly
half
with
children
questions
to
identify
factors
that
influence
acceptance
of
paternalistic
policies
to
the
researchers
surprise
parenting
approach
was
the
best
predictor
for
paternalistic
policy
adoption
more
so
than
political
ideology
political
party
identity
and
other
demographics.</p><p>&quot;i
was
surprised
how
these
results
cut
across
political
parties,&quot
said
lindke
ph.d.
candidate
at
the
center
for
social
innovation
at
the
university
of
california
riverside
and
first
author
on
the
study
quot;each
party
crosses
the
paternalism
line
depending
on
the
issue
being
asked.&quot;</p><p
lakoff
's
model
would
suggest
that
if
the
parenting
metaphor
holds
it
should
be
causal
for
political
attitude
in
the
second
study
oppenheimer
and
his
team
worked
with
participants
to
identify
causal
link
between
parenting
style
and
policy
approach
they
manipulated
the
content
in
the
same
newspaper
article
pro
con
and
neutral
to
evaluate
participants
responses
the
team
could
not
confirm
that
parenting
approach
led
to
policy
preference.</p><p
finally
the
team
assembled
larger
group
of
participants
1,650
for
the
third
study
of
which
almost
had
children
the
results
of
the
third
study
confirmed
the
findings
of
the
first
study
in
addition
they
found
the
paternalistic
approach
expanded
beyond
governmental
policies
to
include
medicine
education
business
peer
relationships
religion
athletics
and
caregiving.</p><p
according
to
lindke
it
may
be
possible
to
activate
person
's
paternalism
when
presented
particular
policy
but
it
is
difficult
to
shift
person
's
attitude
with
regard
to
paternalism.</p><p>&quot;by
knowing
people
's
preferences
for
helicopter
parenting
we
can
predict
people
's
views
on
autonomy
vs.
coercion
in
business
religion
sports
peer
relationships
medicine
politics,&quot
said
oppenheimer
quot;we
can
even
predict
how
middle
aged
people
will
treat
our
aging
parents
in
regards
to
autonomy
which
has
implications
for
geriatric
health.&quot;</p><p
previous
studies
have
found
helicopter
parenting
is
detrimental
to
children
reducing
the
level
of
autonomy
student
engagement
levels
and
satisfaction
with
life
despite
these
negative
implications
the
style
of
helicopter
parenting
is
on
the
rise.</p><p>&quot;i
do
n't
want
to
become
alarmist
because
we
really
do
n't
know
whether
the
effects
on
children
would
be
the
same
as
the
effects
on
citizens,&quot
said
oppenheimer
quot;but
if
being
helicoptered
has
similar
effects
on
adults
as
kids
we
would
expect
to
see
heightened
mental
health
problems
and
lower
self
efficacy
across
society
at
large.&quot;</p><p><em
oppenheimer
and
lindke
worked
together
on
the
study
titled
hovering
at
the
polls
do
helicopter
parents
prefer
paternalistic
political
policies?</em></p
