an
urgent
need</h2
the
university
of

has
worked
with
npc
patients
since
understanding
the
importance
of
patient
advocacy
in
the
fight
for
adequate
treatment
and
health
care
over
the
last
years
as
the
center
has
expanded
research
from
one
disease
to
dozen
rare
diseases
it
has
also
grown
its
advocacy
efforts
via
public
events
community
outreach
and
the
creation
of
new
curriculum.</p
in
the
center
and
notre
dames
launched
to
provide
undergraduate
students
with
critical
skills
and
understanding
of
the
multifaceted
challenges
needed
to
advocate
effectively
for
rare
disease
patients.</p

while
the
clinical
research
in

course
taught
by

starts
by
teaching
the
definition
of
rare
disease
and
patient
advocacy
students
spend
the
bulk
of
the
class
time
working
with
real
npc
patient
medical
records.</p
handful
of
medical
records
voluntarily
given
and
de
identified
are
shared
with
small
teams
of
students
who
are
then
charged
with
compiling
natural
history
for
patients
and
their
families
for
participating
families
the
class
creates
summary
that
streamlines
years
of
medical
history
which
can
be
shared
with
doctors
for
the
students
it
provides
look
at
the
reality
of
living
with
rare
disease
and
the
challenges
of
navigating
cumbersome
health
care
system.</p
throughout
this
process
students
in
the
course
keep
symptom
list
for
their
patient
and
develop
better
understanding
of
clinical
language.</p
the
course
also
works
indirectly
with
rare
cancer
patients
through
collaboration
with
dr.

may
be

but
the
most
rewarding
aspect
of
the

is
the
direct
interaction
between
students

its
an
opportunity
for
families
like
the

to
share
the
nuances

challenges
that
students
may
one
day
be
able
to
