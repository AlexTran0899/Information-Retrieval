this
quick
turnabout
in
some
ways
encapsulates
the
riotous
confrontation
between
the
klan
and
notre
dame
students
in
it
represents
the
students&rsquo
free
spirited
success
in
facing
down
hatred
but
then
gave
way
to
the
real
dangers
of
violent
anti
immigrant
fervor
that
swept
through
indiana
and
much
of
the
nation
and
focused
its
hate
on
both
catholics
and
the
irish.</p
the
parallels
to
the
violent
clashes
in
charlottesville
virginia
one
year
ago
are
inescapable
in
fact
notre
dame
press
decided
to
republish
this
month
in
paperback
book
about
the
event
ldquo;<a

vs

klan/">notre

vs.

by
alumnus
todd
tucker
rsquo;90
in
the
end
the
students&rsquo
unwillingness
to
back
down
to
bigotry
had
lasting
effect
the
klan
never
fully
took
over
south
bend
scrapping
planned
second
rally
and
fading
quickly.</p
the
notre
dame
administration
was
at
first
embarrassed
by
the
stereotype
of
its
catholic
students
throwing
potatoes
and
brawling
but
it
also
never
disciplined
single
student
for
standing
up
to
the
klan
plenty
of
misinformation
and
ldquo;fake
news&rdquo
distort
today&rsquo;s
viewpoint
of
this
long
ago
confrontation
but
closer
look
may
bring
important
context
into
better
focus.</p
the
indiana
Klan</h2
while
it&rsquo;s
true
that
indiana
became
the
heart
of
the
ku
klux
klan
in
the
1920s
mdash
at
one
point
claiming
about
one
in
every
three
native
born
white
males
as
members
mdash
the
facts
don&rsquo;t
tell
the
whole
story.</p
the
klan
had
arisen
in
the
south
after
the
civil
war
as
violent
response
to
the
emancipation
of
slaves
but
that
version
had
largely
died
out
its
revival
began
in
with
the
first
big
budget
movie
ldquo;the
birth
of
nation,&rdquo
which
depicted
the
klan
as
patriotic
force
protecting
the
nation&rsquo;s
decency
and
honor.</p
the
conditions
under
which
the
klan
flourishes
have
always
been
the
same
times
of
great
social
and
religious
change
bring
about
fear
of
outsiders
and
immigrants
provoking
reaction
marked
by
nativism
and
ripe
for
populist
exploitation
the
rise
of
communism
irish
immigration
and
the
threat
of
war
contributed
additional
fear
in
the
roaring
twenties.</p

but
what
made
indiana
unique
was
that
one
man
d.c.
stephenson
engineered
the
klan&rsquo;s
revival
in
the
state
he
was
not
true
believer
or
racist
ideologue
but
he
was
talented
salesman
and
opportunistic
huckster
who
saw
chance
to
exploit
people&rsquo;s
fear
and
nationalism
for
profit
in
1921.</p
instead
of
secret
society
dedicated
to
nighttime
violence
stephenson
sold
this
gentler
klan
as
an
all
american
social
fraternity
that
gathered
for
picnics
and
parades
complete
with
high
school
bands
and
free
barbecue
the
speeches
and
newsletters
focused
on
patriotism
and
virtue.</p
in
less
than
three
years
stephenson
grew
the
indiana
membership
to
more
than
425,000
people
more
than
that
of
alabama
mississippi
and
georgia
combined
as
grand
dragon
his
cut
of
the
klan
membership

made
him
rich

he
used
his
money
and

gain
political
power.</p

it
this
way
in

history
of

ldquo;the
impetus

this

was
not

itself

shrewd
and

at
one
point
the
indiana
klan
even
reached
deal
to
buy
valparaiso
university
and
create
ldquo;100

curriculum.&rdquo
the
deal
fell
apart
when
the
klan&rsquo;s
national
leadership
backed
out
and
the
struggling
school
was
embarrassed
by
the
news
reports.</p
stephenson&rsquo;s
quick
rise
hit
its
zenith
in
when
he
engineered
klan
takeover
of
the
state&rsquo;s
powerhouse
republican
party
his
sales
savvy
included
the
distribution
of
the
klan&rsquo;s
political
slate
on
single
sheet
of
paper
rolled
and
tucked
into
wooden
clothespin
and
delivered
to
thousands
of
hoosier
doorsteps
his
tactics
proved
successful
when
ed
jackson
an
open
klan
member
became
governor
that
year
other
klansmen
won
elections
for
the
mayor
of
indianapolis
its
entire
council
and
other
positions
across
the
state.</p
stephenson
may
not
have
been
true
ideologue
but
he
was
relentless
egomaniac
in
his
power
broking
drinking
and
womanizing
which
would
finally
lead
to
his
downfall.</p
the
Resistance</h2
in

the
1920s
klan
did
not
target
black
people
as
ldquo;the
other&rdquo
because
there
weren&rsquo;t
many
instead
its
nativist
anger
focused
on
the
threat
of
catholicism

was
widely
mistrusted
as
an
anti
american
force

chicago
attorney
patrick

started
magazine
named
ldquo;tolerance&rdquo
to
fight
the
klan&rsquo;s
anti
catholic
propaganda
one
of
his
methods
was
to
find
lists
of
klan
members
and
publish
their
names
highlighting
the
prominent
ones
this
led
the
klan
to
plant
fake
lists
in
an
attempt
to
embarrass
o&rsquo;donnell
and
trigger
lawsuits.</p
one
list
included
the
