explosions
across
kyiv
woke
tymofiy
mylovanov
the
feb.
assault
commenced
russias
invasion
of
ukraine
which
has
since
resulted
in
the
death
of
tens
of
thousands
of
noncombatants
growing
refugee
crisis
and
uncertainty
for
civilians
and
government
officials
across
the
globe.</p
unfortunately
the
university
of
pittsburgh
associate
professor
of
economics
says
the
nightmarish
experience
still
mirrors
daily
life
for
the
citizens
who
remain.</p
mylovanov
who
is
also
ukraine
native
and
president
of
the
kyiv
school
of
economics
stayed
in
the
country
to
advise
the
office
of
the
president
and
share
his
expertise
as
the
nations
previous
economics
minister
to
aid
his
people
and
the
school.</p
his
access
and
knowledge
have
made
him
leading
voice
on
the
war
for
and
other
publications
worldwide
but
his
decision
to
openly
discuss
and
document
the
everyday
lives
of
ukrainians
from
market
and
economic
changes
simple
joy
made
complex
during
wartime
to
political
corruption
have
endeared
him
to
44,000
twitter
followers.</p
ahead
of
the
first
anniversary
of
the
invasion
and
nearly
year
after
pittwire
asked
him
to
share
what
this
year
has
entailed
and
where
he
intends
to
go
from
here.</p
did
you
expect
the
war
to
last
this
long?</h2
yes
and
actually
think
the
war
is
going
to
last
some
more
years
we
are
trying
to
survive
as
nation
and
think
we
are
doing
quite
well
given
the
size
and
determination
of
the
adversary
its
tough
lot
of
people
die
well
just
have
to
persevere.</p
when
we
first
spoke
last
year
you
explained
why
the
war
started
why
is
it
ongoing?</h2
there
were
some
expectations
by
special
western
politicians
and
kind
of
agreed
that
there
was
going
to
be
large
decisive
battle
then
negotiations
there
have
been
at
least
three
now
kyiv
kharkiv
and
kherson
but
it
does
n't
appear
to
be
changing
anything.</p
my
view
is
that
essentially
putin
can
not
take
politically
domestically
the
loss
it
was
major
mistake
and
disaster
for
russia
to
invade
ukraine
that
's
going
to
isolate
russia
for
years
for
decades
impose
huge
losses
and
damage
on
the
population
of
russia
the
future
of
russia
and
prospects
putin
simply
can
not
admit
that
because
politically
he
will
be
done
if
that
happens
that
's
why
he
's
doubling
down
as
most
dictators
do
they
go
down
fighting
until
the
very
last
moment.</p
who
is
winning
the
war?</h2
there
have
been
three
major
battles
kyiv
kherson
and
kharkiv
and
all
were
won
by
ukraine
last
winter
ukraine
successfully
resisted
an
attempt
to
surround
and
take
over
kyiv
in
the
late
summer
there
was
kharkiv
offensive
and
in
the
late
fall
there
was
kherson
the
only
regional
capital
that
was
taken
by
russia
during
the
previous
offensive
they
abandoned
it
because
they
could
n't
keep
it
russia
is
now
pushing
and
sending
tens
of
thousands
of
people
to
die
in
bakhmut
and
in
east
ukraine
but
we
'll
see
how
it
goes
in
my
view
ukraine
is
winning
but
ukraine
has
not
recaptured
all
its
territory
its
going
to
be
long
process.</p
do
nt
want
our
true
voices
from
the
ground
to
be
lost
in
media
or
through
intermediaries.</p
tymofiy
mylovanov
how
do
you
feel
about
how
the
rest
of
the
world
has
responded?</h2
we
have
seen
lot
of
support
which
materializes
in
three
areas
sanctions
military
and
financial
aid
and
of
course
political
that
support
is
great
but
often
late
and
short
this
is
exactly
the
case
in
point
germany
was
refusing
to
give
tanks
only
to
later
say
that
they
're
going
do
it
just
do
n't
understand
because
in
the
end
everything
can
be
given
but
somehow
it
's
later
and
after
so
many
people
die
it
's
just
not
right.</p
whos
been
most
impacted?</h2
everyone
everyone
is
traumatized
in
so
many
ways
but
of
course
soldiers
civilians
in
the
cities
children
refugees
idps
internally
displaced
peoples).</p
people
make
choice
in
russia
you
know
those
who
did
n't
want
to
participate
in
this
war
left
the
country
or
refused
there
are
always
consequences
for
making
the
right
choice
people
whose
decision
was
to
go
to
the
war
they
are
affected
but
they
have
agency
they
realize
what
they
're
doing
they
go
to
different
country
and
kill
civilians
and
try
to
take
land
and
engage
in
war
crimes
torture
and
rape
of
course
they
are
affected
but
they
should
n't
be
doing
this.</p
what
does
everyday
life
look
like
for
those
who
remained?</h2
you
have
european
capital
like
kyiv
where
live
was
just
in
pretty
good
restaurant
and
then
it
gets
blackout
because
our
infrastructure
is
damaged
yesterday
people
were
killed
in
kyiv
and
in
other
cities
of
ukraine
by
russian
missiles
imagine
something
like
israel
but
on
steroids
where
you
can
get
attacked
or
blown
up
anytime
'm
not
even
talking
about
the
front
line
cities
where
they
're
shelled
all
the
time.</p
i'll
give
you
an
example
we
have
this
village
which
was
liberated
and
they
have
school
russians
stole
their
school
buses
and
these
kids
built
makeshift
shed
at
the
cemetery
because
that
where
they
could
get
access
to
telecom
network
to
have
internet
to
watch
the
news
and
to
study
we
provided
them
with
starlinks
satellite
internet
technology
they
re
kilometers
from
the
russian
border
they
get
attacked
daily
but
they
're
eager
to
continue
to
study
they
re
survivors.</p
what
motivates
you
to
document
these
experiences
on
twitter
and
elsewhere
every
day?</h2
im
sharing
because
want
to
explain
to
the
world
what
the
reality
is
do
nt
want
our
true
voices
from
the
ground
to
be
lost
in
media
or
through
intermediaries
what
ve
learned
in
the
war
is
that
essentially
no
one
trusts
anyone
because
the
standard
ways
of
getting
information
do
nt
work
its
just
the
fog
of
war
what
works
is
eyewitness
accounts
so
started
writing
about
the
daily
lives
of
our
students
father
of
kids
idps
refugees
to
show
to
people
how
life
is.</p
what
's
next
for
you
for
the
nation?</h2
keep
working
pragmatically
have
difficult
decision
am
on
faculty
and
the
work
continues
technically
can
not
leave
the
country
for
long
period
without
permit
and
my
pitt
sabbatical
is
over
sometime
in
the
summer
need
to
figure
out
how
to
either
extend
it
or
do
something
about
it
but
here
have
to
continue
to
run
the
kyiv
school
the
war
is
going
to
go
on
for
quite
while
we
need
the
resources
to
keep
going
that
important
so
that
pressure.</p
whats
next
is
to
think
about
how
we
can
be
more
useful
how
we
can
help
our
students
be
successful
how
we
can
help
the
government
how
we
can
help
the
military
how
we
can
help
the
society
idps
veterans
who
are
coming
back.</p
the
role
of
universities
is
huge
during
the
wartime
we
have
the
privilege
of
being
in
academia
and
being
protected
from
many
many
pressures
that
otherwise
would
have
been
crushing
us
so
we
have
to
use
this
opportunity
to
show
leadership
and
to
demonstrate
some
kind
of
hope
and
guidance
at
least
to
the
young
generation.</p
would
like
to
stay
with
pitt
of
course
if
the
war
were
over
then
would
go
back
but
if
the
war
is
not
over
in
the
summer
then
might
not
be
able
to
legally
do
that.</p
is
there
anything
else
you
'd
like
readers
to
know?</h2
just
call
for
support
support
our
students
if
you
can
were
very
very
grateful
for
that.</p
for
those
looking
for
ways
to
help
