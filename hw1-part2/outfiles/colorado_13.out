years

some
tips

help
increase
awareness
around
skill
building
and
resources
to
use
when
working
with
students.</p

awareness</h2
if
students
do
nt
have
enough
time
to
plan
for
and
pursue
skill
building
they
may
approach
graduation
with
some
apprehension
they
may
also
lack
the
necessary
skills
to
be
competitive
in
the
job
market
early
involvement
with
myskills
is
crucial
to
career
preparation.</p
incorporating
myskills
into

experiences
will
help
students
see
the
importance
of
getting
involved
and
pursuing
skill
development.</p

are
many
ways

only
folks
on

you
work
closely
with

key
activities
they
can
complete
to
understand
which
skills
they
have
and
what
skills
employers
want

activities

also
help
students
create
plan
to
get
involved
and
build
skills

they
know
what
career
they
want
or
are
still
deciding.</p
student
supervision
with
focus
on
skills</h2
one
of
the
most
important
connections
students
have
on
campus
is
with
the
supervisor

campus
job
some
students
may
struggle
to
evaluate
their
own
skill
level
by
either
under-
or
over
estimating
their
performance
student
employment
supervisors
have
firsthand
knowledge
of
their
work
and
can
speak
directly
to
their
performance
evaluation

also
natural
part
of
this
professional
relationship

career
readiness
skills

student
job
postings.</li
