cornell
is
training
next
generation
of
solutions
oriented
scholars
and
scientists
to
meet
the
urgent
challenges
facing
our
world
today
plastics
like
polyethylene
and
polypropylene
are
great
materials
we
use
them
for
everything
but
the
problem
is
their
strong
properties
which
make
them
so
great
for
so
many
applications
also
mean
they
do
nt
degrade
we
have
to
do
something
about
that
the
challenges
of
the
world
and
the
big
picture
of
what&rsquo;s
possible
rarely
fit
neatly
into
single
academic
discipline
this
is
why
we&rsquo;ve
made
collaboration
and
communication
way
of
life
at
cornell
we
foster
community
of
renowned
scholars
that
spans
disciplines
locations
and
industries
in
order
to
convert
promising
ideas
and
innovations
into
results
that
truly
matter.</p

talented

another
that
's
why
they
come
to
cornell
they
know
they
can
push
the
boundaries
of
discovery
by
engaging
with
students
who
in
turn
engage
with
and
challenge
them.</p
