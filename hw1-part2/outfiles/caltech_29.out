of
sorts
for

key="3n1nd">"Our
lab
typically
works
on
interesting
materials
which
respond
to
external
stimuli
because
of
the
way
we
build
them
into
specific
micro-
or
nano
architectures
what
's
so
interesting
and
exciting
about
mpecs
is
that
they
can
be
actuated
even
without
that
kind
of
architecture
says
the
ruben

donna
mettler
professor
of
materials
science
mechanics
and
medical
engineering
and
the
fletcher
jones
foundation
director
of
the
at
caltech
she
explains
that
these
materials
can
exhibit
vastly
different
properties
and
responses
for
example
by
choice
of
metal
ion
and
ph
sample
can
be
made
that
bends
to
the
left
or
to
the
right
depending
on
how
fast
force
is
applied
to
it
in
another
case
sample
can
fully
dissolve
in
water
or
remain
solid
for
several
days
with
the
only
difference
being
the
metal
's
ionic
charge.</p><p

lot
of
this

the
time
we
had
no
idea

present
walker
says
other
papers
have
looked
at
one
or
two
effects
at
most
in
their
study
the
fact
that
we
were
able
to
couple
all
three

the
fact
that
we
are
able
to
not
only
understand
how
each
of
them
interacts
with
each
other
but
how
they
then
impact

it

when

aluminum

based
on
the
theoretical

just
as
expected
