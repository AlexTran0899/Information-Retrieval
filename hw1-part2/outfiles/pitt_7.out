those

how
adding
brain

that
evokes
tactile
sensations
makes
it

for
the
operator

manipulate

controlled
robotic
arm
in

with
artificial

cut
the
time
spent

in
half
from
median
time
of

in

this
is
what
we

would
happenbut
perhaps
not

sensory

study
participant
nathan
copeland
whose
progress
was
described
in
the
paper
was
the
first
person
in
the
world
to
be
implanted
with
tiny
electrode
arrays
not
just
in
his
brains
motor
cortex
but
also
in
his
somatosensory
cortexa
region
of
the
brain
that
processes
sensory
information
from
the
body
arrays
allow
him
to
control
the
robotic
arm
with
his
mind
as
well
as
to
receive
tactile
sensory
feedback
which
is
similar
to
how
neural
circuits
operate
when
persons
spinal
cord
is
intact.</p
was
already
extremely
familiar
with
both
the
sensations
generated
by
stimulation
and
performing
the
task
without
stimulation
even
though
the
sensation
is
nt
naturalit
feels
like
pressure
and
gentle
tinglethat
never
bothered
me
said
copeland
there
was
n't
really
any
point
where
felt
like
stimulation
was
something
had
to
get
used
to
doing
the
task
while
receiving
the
stimulation
just
went
together
like
pb&amp;j.</p
after
car
crash
that
left
him
with
limited
use
of
his
arms
copeland
enrolled
in
clinical
trial
testing
the
sensorimotor
microelectrodebrain
computer

and
was
implanted
with
four
microelectrode
arrays
developed
byblackrock

commonly
referred
to
as
utah
arrays).</p
this
paper
is
step
forward
from
an
earlier
study
that
described
for
the
first
timehow
stimulating
sensory
regions
of
the
brain
using
tiny
electrical
pulses
can
in
distinct
regions
of
persons
hand
even
though
they
had
lost
feeling
in
their
limbs
due
to
spinal
cord
injury
in
this
new
study
the
researchers
combined
reading
the
information
from
the
brain
to
control
the
movement
of
the
robotic
arm
with
writing
information
back
in
to
provide
sensory
feedback.</p
in
series
of
tests
in
which
the
bci
operator
was
asked
to
pick
up
and
transfer
various
objects
from
table
to
raised
platform
providing
tactile
feedback
through
electrical
stimulation
allowed
the
participant
to
complete
tasks
twice
as
fast
compared
to
tests
without
stimulation.</p
in
the
new
paper
the
researchers
wanted
to
test
the
effect
of
sensory
feedback
in
conditions
that
would
resemble
the
real
world
as
closely
as
possible.</p
we
did
nt
want
to
constrain
the
task
by
removing
the
visual
component
of
perception
