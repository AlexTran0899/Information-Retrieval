its
social
economic
and
political
impactseffects

the

visited
museums
and
historical
sites
in
six
cities
over
six
days
that
were
foundational

movement
and
in
many
cases

were
able
to
hear
and
see
firsthand
accounts
from
survivors
of
some
of
those
events
as
well
as
past-
and
present
day
civil

leaders.</p><p
meeting
people
who
have
actually
lived
these
experiences
that
not
just
something
you
can
know
says
first
year
student
zacharius
khan
have
lot
more
to
learn
that
why
coming
on
this
trip
was
important.</p><p
mlk
instructor
ezra
hyland
says
that
the

theme
of
the

is
now
is
appropriate.</p><p
history

history
is
current
event
says
hyland
this
has
been
wonderful
opportunity
for
us
to
see
how
we
got
here
its
something
think
that
everyone
in
america
should
try
and
do.</p><p
the
course
is
offered
through
the
which
provides
educational
experiences
that
foster
students
engagement
with
issues
of
power
privilege
and
social
