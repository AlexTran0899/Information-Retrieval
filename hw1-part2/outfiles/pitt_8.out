this
creative
chemist
helped
crack
COVID-19
mystery
lillian
chong
createssimulations
that
mimic
biological
processes
too
small
and
too
fast
to
be
observed
by
even
the
most
sophisticated
microscope
the
result
is
videos
that
show
what
happening
with
every
atom
of
protein
cell
down
to
thequadrillionth
million
billionth
of
second.</span></span></span></span></p
using
this
technology
chong
helped
crack
the
mystery
of
how
the
coronaviruss
spike
protein
opens
in
order
to
attach
to
human
cells.</span></span></span></span></p
in
the
spring
of
chongs
lab</span></span></a><span><span
in
pitts
kenneth
p.
dietrich
school
of
arts
and
sciences
joined
forces
with
two
labs
at
the
university
of
california
san
diego
to</span></span><a

simulate
the
coronavirus
in
atomic

detail</span></span></a><span><span
the
simulation
effectively
slowed
down
and
zoomed
in
on
that
spike
motion
revealing
a</span></span><span><span
gate
that
must
open
for
the
virus
to
infect
the
body</span></span>.</span></span></p
the
simulation
which
contained
million
atoms
took
only
days
to
create
using
an
advanced
simulation
method
which
was
actually
quite
fast
it
would
have
taken
years
with
standard
technology
the
team
moved
so
quickly
because
it
used
the
tacc
longhorn
supercomputer
and
software
package
created
by
chong
to
make
simulations
more
efficient
called
westpa
the
weighted
ensemble
simulation
toolkit
with
parallelization
and
analysis).</span></span></span></span></p
this
groundbreaking
achievement
was
instrumental
in
winning
an
international
team
of
scientists
the
gordon
bell
special
prize
for
hpc
based
COVID-19
research
commonly
referred
to
as
the
nobel
prize
of
supercomputing
notably
the
team
was
woman
led
and
consisted
of
large
number
of
females
in
male
dominated
field.</span></span></span></span></p
chong
has
bevy
of
other
honors
including
national
science
foundation
career
award
and
the
university
of
pittsburgh
tina
and
david
bellet
teaching
excellence
award
but
more
than
awards
chong
finds
joy
in
the
process
of
discovery
in
chemistry
and
the
art
both
of
which
she
discovered
as
child.</span></span></span></span></p
she
recalls
one
of
her
high
school
chemistry
teachers
handing
out
mystery
molecules
to
each
student
and
tasking
them
to
uncover
its
identity
using
various
experiments
not
everyone
solved
their
mystery
chong
did
but
the
best
part
was
the
experience
of
testing
and
trying.</span></span></span></span></p
her
teacher
also
used
colorful
metaphors
to
illustrate
scientific
concepts
an
ion
is
surrounded
by
molecules
like
an
entourage
of
friends
that
follow
it
around
chemicals
in
mixture
being
separated
are
like
frogs
leaping
to
different
lengths
the
crisp
language
applied
to
science
appealed
to
her
growing
up
chong
wrote
poetry
and
today
she
part
of
weekly
writing
group
where
participants
share
ideas
and
encourage
each
others
works
in
progress.</span></span></span></span></p
at
pitt
she
wanted
to
offer
students
the
chance
topairliterary
art
with
science
so
she
foundedthe
summer
workshop
in
creative
science
writing
in
in
collaboration
with
instructors
in
the
department
of
english
including
poet
sam
pittman
chong
organized
summer
fellowship
for
undergraduates
to
explore
creative
writing
alongside
lab
study
students
wrote
about
science
related
topics
in
any
genre
narrative
journalism
poetry
graphic
novels
with
guidance
from
mentors
english
instructors
offered
creative
prompts
and
lessons
on
word
choice
or
using
commas
for
flow
chong
taught
about
conveying
science
with
clarity
and
sometimes
showed
simulations
of
brightly
colored
proteins
dancing
on
screen
to
evoke
sense
of
imagination.</span></span></span></span></p
lillian
is
so
smart
but
also
curious
and
excited
about
everything
she
talks
about
which
makes
her
great
teacher
pittman
said.</span></span></span></span></p
creative
writing
is
also
one
way
chong
maintains
balance
amid
the
demands
of
academic
life
its
something
she
learned
from
her
father
who
immigrated
to
the
u.s.
from
hong
kong
and
worked
as
an
engineering
professor
and
later
program
director
at
thenational
science
foundation
chong
also
practices
meditation
and
yoga
and
regularly
hikes
through
pittsburgh
parks
especially
frick
and
schenley
on
her
mile
walk
to
campus
from
home.</span></span></span></span></p
