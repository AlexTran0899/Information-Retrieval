three
pitt
alumni
were
among
those
competing
for
checkered
flag
at
the
indianapolis
motor
speedway
last
week
as
the
countrys
top
auto
racing
bodies
indycar
and
nascar
held
two
separate
races
over
the
annual
eardrum
rattling

hit
the
world
famous
racetrack
on
saturday
for
the
gallagher
grand
prix
the
team
took
third
place
on
the
podium
with
driver
pato
oward
piloting
the
no
car.</p
the
next
day
former
pitt
wrestling
teammates
donnie
tasser
a&amp;s
and
matt
wilps
a&amp;s
competed
against
each
other
in

both

tasser

motorsports
no
car
and
wilps
for
front
row
motorsports
no
car
their
cars
finished
fifth
and
38th
respectively.</p
in
racing
victory
and
defeat
are
decided
by
mere
hundredths
of
second
for
pit
crew
members
like
wilps
and
tasser
that
means
changing
pound
tire
in
less
than
nine
seconds
or
about
the
time
it
takes
the
average
person
to
buckle
their
seat
belt
and
start
the
engine
for
performance
engineers
like
gundlach
the
equation
is
even
more
complicated
she
responsible
for
helping
to
achieve
the
fastest
lap
time
possible
relying
on
countless
points
of
data
observation
and
the
instincts
of
her
driver
lessons
she
first
learned
as
member
of
the
swanson
school
of
engineerings
racing
team.</p
its
almost
more
game
of
psychology
than
it
is
engineering
gundlach
said.</p
and
it
does
nt
end
on
the
track
working
in
motor
sports
is
grind
most
weekends
are
spent
on
the
road
and
life
events
including
the
scheduled
cesarean
section
birth
of
tassers
second
child
have
to
be
worked
around
races.</p
honestly
do
nt
know
what
else
be
doing
tasser
said
you
trade
the
less
optimal
parts
of
the
job
for
the
obvious
benefits
chasing
championships.</p
you
do
nt
do
it
because
its
easy
gundlach
said
you
do
it
because
you
love
it.</p
