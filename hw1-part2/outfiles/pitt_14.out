teams

to
talk
to
each
other
to
work
together
but
for
the
tiniest
cooperators
too
much
communication
may
not
be
good
thing
new
research
from
group
including
pitt
physicists
shows
that
both
too
little
and
too
much
communication
can
hinder
how
cells
respond
to
their
environment
the
results
may
have
implications
for
understanding
how
groups
of
cells
from
collections
of
amoeba
to
the
those
that
govern
the

unite

you
would
think
that
the
better
they
can
communicate
with

the

they
become
more

that
not
quite
true.</span></span></span></p
while
scientists
have
extensively
studied
the
way
some
types
of
brain
cells
learn
as
group
the
same
is
nt
true
of
cells
that
lack
the
ability
to
make
complex
specialized
connections
to
one
another
and
yet
in
many
cases
even
these
simpler
cells
manage
to
coordinate
in
response
to
their
environment
to
study
this
coordination
pitt
researchers
worked
with
colleagues
at
oregon
state
university
to
put
together
simplified
system
where
they
could
study
kind
of
brain
cell
that
communicates
with
chemicals
in
simpler
way
resembling
single
celled
organisms
and
the
cells
that
make
up
the
rest
of
our
bodies
sketching
out
how
the
network
of
these
cells
behave
revealed
an
optimal
amount
of
communication
not
too
much
and
not
too
little
that
lets
them
respond
to
their
environment
together
the
team
in
the
journal
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
on
sept.
the
researchers
were
initially
perplexed
by
the
experiments

physics
associate
professor
in

school
and
lefebres
advisor
we
did
nt
understand
what
we
were
seeing
until
we
actually
wrote
down
mathematical
model
then
we
could
drill
down
and
say
lets
just
take
two
cells
mugler
said
scaling
up
that
simplified
model
led
the
team
to
understand
how
interactions
between
individual
cells
produced
the
larger
scale
patterns
of
the
network
changing
the
speed
of
fluctuations
in
the
cell
networks
environment
also
influenced
how
well
the
cells
could
respond
if
the
environment
changes
too
quickly
the
cells
ca
nt
coordinate
effectively
key
to
the
teams
experimental
setup
are
cells
from
part
of
the
brain
that
important
in
reproduction
and
metabolism
and
that
react
to
chemical
called
atp
by
releasing
calcium
into
their
environment
researchers
were
able
to
change
the
experiment
to
alter
how
effectively
the
cells
passed
around
chemical
messages
and
used
statistics
to
show
which
cells
act
as
leaders
and
followers
at
given
time
the
system
mugler
explained
is
typical
of
those
favored
by
biological
physicists
like
his
team
its
lifelike
enough
to
resemble
natural
cell
networks
but
simple
enough
to
be
manipulated
studied
and
described
using
math
its
sandbox
for
the
collective
behavior
of
cells
mugler
said
we
can
wrap
our
heads
around
it
and
we
can
control
it
while
this
is
an
early
step
in
understanding
how
networks
of
cells
respond
to
their
environment
collectively
building
that
understanding
may
provide
insight
into
number
of
diseases
including
cancer
lot
of
times
when
we
get
malfunction
in
tissues
it
comes
from
lack
of
coordination
between
cells
mugler
said
in
tumor
growth
and
metastasis
cells
stop
being
member
of
the
team
and
acquire
more
individualistic
less
coordinated
nature
next
the
team
is
working
on
modeling
more
complex
networks
of
cells
by
placing
neurons
in
randomly
generated
mazes
bringing
into
reality
ideas
from
branch
of
statistics
called
percolation
theory.</span></span></span></p
think
its
going
to
produce
some
pretty
cool
results
