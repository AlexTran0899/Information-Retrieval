carney
institute
for
brain
science
the
as
one
of
its
core
missions
the
institute
is
developing
and
supporting
series
of
interdisciplinary
research
centers
that
focus
on
established
or
emerging
areas
of
excellence
in
brain
research
at
brown
each
center
bridges
the
physical
and
life
sciences
and
encompasses
basic
and
translational
research
including
clinical
application.<a

rel="nofollow">the
center
for
vision
research</a
was
created
in
initiatives
in
neurotechnology
and
in
synaptic
and
neurodegenerative
disease
are
underway
carney
institutehas
also
established
an
mri
research
facility
and
an
behavioral
analysis
core
facility
the
existence
of
brain
science
as
an
overall
organizing
entity
for
series
of
research
centers
and
core
facilities
demonstrates
the
university
's
ongoing
support
for
brain
science
research
at
brown
this
commitment
will
help
to
attract
top
faculty
and
students
to
brown
enable
higher
quality
research
and
establish
brown
as
worldwide
leader
in
brain
science
brown
initiative
for
computation
in
brain
and
mind
computational
methods
have
been
enormously
productive
for
understanding
complexities
inherent
in
natural
systems
from
the
weather
to
aerodynamics
physics
and
biology
the
brain
is
perhaps
the
most
complex
and
interesting
of
these
systems
the
problem
of
understanding
the
relationship
between
brain
and
mind
is
so
immensely
complex
that
close
interaction
among
theorists
and
experimentalists
is
required
to
gain
deeper
understanding
of
fundamental
brain
and
cognitive
processes
because
of
the
many
levels
spanning
from
molecules
to
cognition
multiple
levels
of
computer
simulations
from
those
focused
on
details
of
neuronal
function
to
those
focused
on
the
abstract
computations
that
emerge
from
these
networks
can
be
fruitfully
applied
to
bridge
this
gap
brown
's
is
place
where
these
types
of
interactions
regularly
occur
across
faculty
members
and
across
students
at
all
levels
data
science
initiative
browns
data
science
initiative
dsi
is
cross
disciplinary
collaboration
between
four
core
foundational
departments
applied
mathematics
biostatistics
computer
science
and
mathematics
to
catalyze
data
enabled
science
and
scholarship
across
the
campus
the
collaborations
between
these
departments
deepens
browns
the
data
science
expertise
and
creates
new
opportunities
for
innovation
in
both
the
methods
and
the
applications
of
data
science
browns
data

initiative
leverages
established
academic
strength
to
builda
campus
hub
for
research
and
education
in
foundational
methodologies
of
data
science
maintaining
an
outward
focus
on
application
areas
and
critical
engagement
with
questions
of

robotics
initiative
the
hcri
is
group
of
brown
university
faculty
students
and
affiliates
dedicated
to
robotics
as
means
to
tackle
the
problems
the
world
faces
today
beyond
pursuing
the
goal
of
technological
advancement
hcri
wants
to
ensure
that
these
advancements
are
applicable
and
beneficial
economically
and
socially
hcri
is
working
across
many
disciplines
to
document
the
societal
needs
and
applications
of
human
robot
interaction
research
as
well
as
the
ethical
legal
and
economic
questions
that
will
arise
with
its
development
their
research
ultimately
aims
to
help
create
and

that
coexist
harmoniously
