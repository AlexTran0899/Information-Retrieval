when
nasas
james
webb
space
telescope
launched
in
late
the
work
for
some
scientists
was
just
beginning
as
the
observatory
reached
its
deep
space
destination
its
hexagonal
mirrors
had
to
be
deployed
and
aligned
over
several
months
by
engineers
working
round
the
clock.</span></p
one
of
those
scientists
was
katie
melbourne
who
at
the
time
was
part
time
cu
student
and
scientist
at
colorado
based
ball
aerospace
the
company
designed
and
built
the
advanced
optical
technology
and
lightweight
mirror
system
that
will
allow
webb
to
look
billion
years
back
in
time
adding
to
earthlings
knowledge
of
the
evolution
and
properties
of
distant
galaxies
got
really
lucky
because
was
actually
on
shift
when
they
stepped
out
all
the
mirrors
from
their
stowed
position
and
the
mirrors
were
fully
deployed
she
said.</p
melbournes
team
focused
on
properly
positioning
each
of
the
mirrors
task
requiring
intense
patience
and
precision
we
were
working
on
aligning
the
mirrors
so
that
webb
can
actually
take
science
data
and
so
that
four
to
six
month
24/7
process
she
said
that
painstaking
work
paid
off
as
the
telescope
captured
its
first
remarkable
images
in
mid-2022.</span></p
grew
up
with
webb
being
this
future
thing
and
thinking
maybe
ill
do
astronomy
and
use
data
from
it
someday
working
on
it
was
dream
come
true
said
melbourne

is
now
pursuing

melbournes
work

are
emblematic
of
the
ongoing

historic
collaborations
between

the

continues
to
sponsor

the
partnership
endures
in
another
influential

paved
the
way
for

to
turn

to
study

the

set
their

to
measure
deep
ultraviolet

emanating
from

with
that

improve

it
was
no

for

as

that

saying
hey

in

and
crucially
brought
with
them
their

despite
lucrative
contracts
in
ball
aerospaces
early
days
innovation
was
expensive
and
the
nascent
companys
profitability
faltered
in
they
brought
in
ruel
merc
mercure
to
help
write
balls
next
chapter
mercure
had
gotten
his
phd
in
physics
at
cu
boulder
and
had
designed
the
instrument
that
photographed
the
sun
while
atop
the
aerobee
rocket.</span></p
years
later
mercure
told
the
denver
post
what
it
was
like
in
those
early
days
of
launching
rockets
and
ultimately
the
space
business
it
was
great
great
great
great
fun
he
said
the
word
today
is
passionthats
probably
good
way
to
describe
all
of
us
that
were
involved
at
the
timenobody
had
done
these
things
before
aerospace
was
very
very
new.</span></p
mercure
wrote
in
his
cu
dissertation
that
space
was
an
area
of
scientific
endeavor
in
which
the
smallest
success
brings
with
it
great
personal
sense
of
achievement
and
pleasure
nevertheless
it
was
giant
leaps
that
lay
ahead
merc

and
reusable

at
time
when

were
becoming
an
important

the

said
kyle

worked

as

of
the
founding

mercure
helped
put
cu

the
city
of

at
the
center

he
also
encouraged
innovation

who

launch

into
the
pantheon
of

and

died
on
feb.
in

he
was
90.</p
mercure
ultimately
moved
on
from

to
found
and
invest
in
several
other
ventures
and
to
impacton
an
even
larger
scalehow

he
returned
to
cu
boulder
in
to
serve
as
among
other
positions
director
of
cus
new
technology
transfer
office.</span></p
at
the
time
the
u.s.
government
had
recently
begun
to
grant
ownership
of
inventions
back
to
the
universities
that
had
created
them
with
federal
funding
which
enabled
the
field
of
tech
transfer
to
better
connect
academic
innovation
with
the
mainstream
economyboosting
economic
development
in
the
process
dubbed
the
bayh
dole
act
the
legislation
allowed
universities
to
license
federally
funded
inventions
to
private
industry
which
cu
soon
did.</span></p
lefkoff
worked
on
tech
transfer
with
mercure
from
to
merc
and
helped
cu
design
the
tech
transfer
program
based
on
what
was
best
practice
among
the
best
universities
at
the
time
he
said
we
let
the
professors
know
that
when
you
invent
something
at
cu
if
you
have
the
human
capital
to
make
that
happen
there
no
institutional
barrier
that
was
an
epiphany
for
many
of
them
mercure
parted
that
sea
of
institutional
resistance
and
created
opportunity.</span></p
given
his
monumental
success
in
business
it
may
seem
like
an
unusual
move
for
someone
like
mercure
to
return
to
academia
but
not
to
those
who
knew
him
think
it
was
natural
for
him
he
was
probably
at
that
time
one
of
the
only
people
who
knew
how
to
take
university
technology
or
innovation
and
translate
that
into
real
business
said

rees

vice
chancellor
for

and

of

at

nowadays
lot
of
people
have
experience
doing
that
kind
of
thing
but
that
just
simply
did
nt
exist
back
then
and
ball
aerospace
was
really
unprecedented
in
that
way.</span></p
today

such

that
the

have
dreamed
of
decades

today
for

its
the
continuation
of

for

that
