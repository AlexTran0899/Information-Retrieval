six
billion
years
ago
two
galaxies
were
colliding
their
combined
forces
hurling
stream
of
gas
hundreds
of
thousands
of
light
years
away
reported
this
week
by
team
including
pitt
astronomers
that
unusual
feature
provides
new
possible
explanation
for
why
galaxies
stop
forming
stars
one
of
the
biggest
questions
in
astronomy
is
why
the
biggest
galaxies
are
dead
said
sixth
year
physics
and
astronomy
phd
student
in
the
kenneth
p.
dietrich
school
of
arts
and
sciences
what
we
saw
is
that
if
you
take
two
galaxies
and
smash
them
together
that
can
actually
rip
gas
out
of
the
galaxy
itself.</span></span></span></p
in
the
part
of
space
we
inhabit
most
large
galaxies
have
long
ago
stopped
making
new
stars
only
recently
have
astronomers
started
looking
farther
away
and
thus
farther
back
in
time
with
the
tools
to
find
recently
dead
galaxies
and
figure
out
how
they
got
that
way
the
cold
gas
that
coalesces
to
form
stars
might
escape
from
galaxies
by
several
means
blown
away
by
black
holes
or
supernovae
and
there
an
even
simpler
possibility
that
galaxies
simply
quiet
down
when
they
ve
used
up
all
the
raw
materials
for
creating
stars
looking
for
examples
of
galaxies
that
recently
shut
off
star
formation
the
team
of
researchers
used
the
sloan
digital
sky
survey
which
has
catalogued
millions
of
galaxies
with
telescope
at
apache
point
observatory
in
new
mexico
along
with
observations
from
the
ground
based
radio
astronomy
network
alma
the
researchers
found
just
such
post
starburst
galaxy
seven
billion
light
years
away
that
still
showed
signs
of
available
star
forming
fuel
so
then
we
needed
an
explanation
said
setton
if
it
has
gas
why
is
it
not
forming
stars?</span></span></span></p

second
pass
with
the
hubble
space
telescope
then
revealed
the
distinctive
tail
of
gas
extending
from
the
galaxy
from
that
feature
like
forensic
examiners
working
through
telescope
the
researchers
were
able
to
reconstruct
the
galaxies
collision
and
the
tremendous
gravitational
force
that
tore
apart
stars
and
flung
stream
of
gas
distance
more
than
two
milky
ways
laid
end
to
end
that
was
the
smoking
gun
said
setton
we
were
all
so
struck
by
it
you
just
do
nt
see
this
much
gas
this
far
away
from
the
galaxy
the
team
including
pitt
physics
and
astronomy
associate
professor
and
alum
margaret
verrico
a&amp;s
along
with
colleagues
at
texas
a&amp;m
university
and
several
other
institutions
reported
their
results
in
the
on
aug.
such
an
extreme
meeting
of
galaxies
is
likely
rare
setton
said
but
because
gravity
pulls
large
objects
into
dense
groups
such
an
event
is
more
common
than
you
might
anticipate
there
are
all
these
big
voids
in
space
but
all
of
the
biggest
galaxies
live
in
the
spaces
where
all
of
the
other
big
galaxies
live
he
said
you
expect
to
see
these
sorts
of
big
collisions
once
every
billion
years
or
so
for
system
this
massive.</span></span></span></p
settons
role
on
the
project
was
to
determine
the
galaxys
size
and
shape
and
he
discovered
that
other
than
the
tail
the
post
merger
galaxy
looked
surprisingly
normal
once
the
tail
fades
in
few
hundred
million
years
it
may
look
just
like
any
other
dead
galaxy
further
suggesting
that
the
process
could
be
more
common
than
it
appears
something
the
team
is
following
up
now
with
another
survey.</span></span></span></p
along
with
providing
clues
for
how
the
universe
became
the
way
it
is
setton
said
such
collisions
reflect
one
possibility
for
the
future
of
our
own
galaxy
if
you
go
to
dark
place
and
look
up
at
the
night
sky
you
can
see
the
andromeda
galaxy
which
in
five
billion
years
might
do
exactly
this
to
our
milky
way
setton
said
its
helping
answer
the
fundamental
question
of
what
going
to
happen
to
the
milky
way
in
the
future.</span></span></span></p
