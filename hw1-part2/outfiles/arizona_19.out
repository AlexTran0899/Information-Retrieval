the

definitely
helped

not

you
to
be

but
they
also
expect
you
to
take
in
new
people
guide
them

It&#x27;s
not

about

it

when

was
able
to
provide

with

that
helped
chip
away
an

two
off
my
plan
why
did
you
choose
arizona?</strong></span><br/><span
class="text

primarily
made
my
decisions
for
school
based
on
location
just
didn&#x27;t
want
to
be
on
the
east
coast
anymore
had
come
here
before
for
the
warrior
scholar
project
and
really
liked
the
campus
and
the
city
loved
the
desert
There&#x27;s
just
something
about
it
that
was
so
magical
to
me.</span></p><p><span

what
drew
you
to
our
nursing
program?</strong></span><br/><span
class="text

had
an
inkling
of
wanting
to
get
into
the
medical
field
and
nursing
was
probably
the
go
to
because
always
felt
they
were
little
more
hands
on
than
the
doctors
and
I&#x27;m
people
person
once
decided
on
the
location
started
looking
into
the
program
itself
the
nursing
program
is
very
competitive
they
accept
students
out
of
semester
so
feel
like
they
hold
us
to
higher
standard
can
look
to
my
left
and
right
and
know
that
these
people
care
as
much
as
do.</span></p><p></p><h2><span

they

love
the

center
so
that&#x27;s
another
big
piece
of
my
choice
in
school
the
center
is
nice
little
bit
of
everything
It&#x27;s
social
space
study
space
and
place
where
you
can
go
just
sit
down
and
rest
your
feet
for
minutes
I&#x27;m
really
excited
that
have
the
opportunity
not
only
to
go
in
and
use
the
vets
centers
as
resource
but
I&#x27;m
