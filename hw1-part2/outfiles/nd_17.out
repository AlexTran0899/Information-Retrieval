getting

marys
maternal
love
for

was
more
powerful

juan

alvarez
said
his
wife
and
classmates
were
overwhelmed&ndash;often
to
the
point
of
tears&ndash;at
the
opportunity
to
bring
their
praises
and
sufferings
to
the
holy
site
he
discerned
powerful
lesson
that
we
often
do
nt
know
the
pain
other

carry
in
their
lives.</p

felt
the
deep
popular
piety
of
the
people
of
mexico
in
joining
other
pilgrims
at
the
most
visited
catholic
shrine
in
the
world
she
said
the
experience
forced
the
students
to
ask
themselves
profound
questions
about
their
role
as
future
ministers.</p
how
does
this
impact
my
ministerial
identity
king
said
how
does
this
help
me
serve
those
who
are
the
most
marginalized
and
vulnerable
and
how
has
this
helped
me
to
be
able
to
reach
out
to
more
people
or
experience
different
reality
of
the
church
than
my
own?</p
these
reactions
adeptly
fit
the
purpose
of
program
designed
to
build
intercultural
competence
among
divinity
students
so
they
can
better
serve
multicultural
catholic
church
as
future
pastoral

weve
built

that
has
excellent

pastoral
human

top

in

the
influential
recently
ranked
notre

as
no

list
it
has
topped
in
three
of
the
past
four
years.</p
but
we
are
in
an
increasingly
diverse
u.s.
church
and
global
church
he
said
and
so
to
prepare
our
students
to
minister
in
the
church
of
today
much
less
the
church
of
tomorrow
it
demands
greater
intercultural
competency.</p
our
program
is
built
about
around
helping
students
engage
new
cultural
context
or
new
population
with
posture
of
receptivity
posture
of
empathy&ndash;where
you
re
not
coming
in
as
the
savior
but
you
re
coming
in
to
be
formed
and
then
contribute
and
to
be
with
the
people.</p

to
young
latinos
at
catholic
colleges
around
the
country
with
notre

and
boston
college
as
the
lead
institutions
walatka
pointed
out
that
more
than
half
of
u.s.
catholics
under
are
latino
so
the
driving
impetus
of
the
third
phase
is
lifting
up
the
next
generation
of
latino
leaders
in
the
church
the
future
of
the
catholic
parish
in
the
united
states
is
multicultural
parish
where
you
re
going
to
have
masses
in
english
and
spanish
so
our
graduates
need
to
be
able
to
enter
into
that
kind
of
space
with
the
competency
to
enter
into
dialogue

recently
hired
as
the
director
of

which
will
kick
off
in

at
the
end
of

alvarez
said
they
hope
to
identify
young
people
with
an
interest
and
open
doors
for
them
at
different
institutions
of
higher
learning.</p
we
accompany
them
throughout
their
formation
in
graduate
school
with
opportunities
for
mentorship
networking
and
financial
support
he
said
we
hope
that
students
will
be
served
then
they
ll
go
out
and
plug
back
into
their
communities
and
hopefully
inspire
more
students
in
rippling

masters
of
divinity
students
in
mexico
alvarez
was
born
in
mexico
but
went
with
his
family
to
work
as
migrant
field
workers
in
america
every
summer
until
he
was
when
they
settled
in
colorado
he
got
his
undergraduate
degree
in
theology
at
notre
dame
in
and
worked
in
catholic
high
schools
and
parishes
in
chicago
but
he
returned
for
his
master
's
in
divinity
to
get
more
formation
in
his
vocational
call
to
serve
low
income
latino
families
where
he
saw
extraordinary
need
he
helped
plan
the
pilgrimage
to
mexico
and
said
he
appreciated
the
enthusiasm
his
fellow
students
displayed
ive
seen
instances
in
the
catholic
church
where
cultural
sensitivity
or
competence
or
familiarity
could
have
been
lot
better
alvarez
said
for
me
it
means
lot
when
someone
who
not
latino
is
taking
an
interest
in
the
culture
and
getting
the
background
to
be
able
to
then
go
into
ministry
and
accompany
people
little
bit
of
interest
goes
long
way
so
to
see
my
classmates
trying
spanish
even
speaking
poorly
we
welcome
all
that.</p
walatka
said
the
notre
dame
masters
program
in
divinity
integrates
intense
human
spiritual
pastoral
and
intellectual
formation
while
he
heads
the
intellectual
effort
leads
pastoral
formation
and
leads
human
and
spiritual
formation.</p
of
the
programs
integration
is
training
lay
students
and
holy
cross
seminarians
together
both
in
classrooms
and
in
supervised
field
placements
in
ministry
wrestling
together
with
difficult
pastoral
situations
he
said
addresses
major
challenge
in
the
relationship
between
clergy
and
lay
people
the
students
seem
to
agree.</p

ryan
the
seminarian
grew
up
in
notre
dame
family
near
boston
with
two
parents
who
are
alumni
and
teachers
and
two
brothers
in
the
ace
program
he
moved
into
as
junior
to
prepare
for
the
graduating
in
2019.</P
he
said
forming
deep
relationships
with
lay
classmates
will
make
him
better
priest
and
person
to
be
able
to
have
people
can
go
to
who
know
me
and
who
know
what
ministry
is
as
well
to
ask
them
what
they
think
but
also
to
have
wide
range
of
perspectives&ndash;thats
really
important
ryan
said
in
very
simple
way
the
majority
of
the
church
are
not
priests
and
we
ca
nt
be
separate.</p
ryan
said
he
fell
in
love
with
the
family
business
of
teaching
when
he
taught
fifth
grade
this
summer
and
the
mexico
pilgrimage
provided
an
opportunity
to
embrace
the
whole
person.</p
included
in
that
is
someones
culture
because
you
ca
nt
really
have
person
outside
culture
he
said
there
way
in
which
the
gospel
can
speak
to
each
culture
not
necessarily
that
were
changing
the
gospel
but
emphasizing
how
are
we
going
to
color
the
gospel
in
such
way
that
it
speaks
to
people.</p
king
who
is
an
assistant
rector
in
ryan
hall
grew
up
in
texas
with
mexican
american
mother
and
irish
german
father&ndash;between
both
cultures
but
anchored
in
the
catholic
church
she
began
as
finance
major
at
university
of
the
incarnate
word
but
switched
to
theology
after
getting
involved
in
campus
ministry
king
will
work
as
director
of
youth
ministry
at
st.
adalberts
after
she
graduates.</p
she
agreed
with
ryan
that
undergoing
formation
with
future
priests
was
crucial
especially
because
female
perspective
is
needed
have
classmate
that
just
did
her
final
presentation
on
breastfeeding
and
pregnancy
and
theology
and
know
for
the
seminarians
they
were
like
wow
these
are
just
things
never
considered
before.</p
king
did
an
immersion
program
over
the
summer
at
in
brownsville
texas
near
the
mexican
border
even
though
she
grew
up
in
mexican
american
family
she
said
the
cultural
competency
training
was
valuable
because
she
had
never
confronted
migrants
before
was
able
to
encounter
the
deep
faith
that
people
have
king
said
they
re
displaced
they
literally
showed
up
without
shoelaces
we
were
able
to
meet
material
needs
but
also
provide
some
sort
of
spiritual
nourishment
just
witnessing
the
hope
that
people
have
that
god
has
plan
for
their
lives
and
that
carried
them
this
far&ndash;it
was
transformative
and
do
nt
think
my
heart
will
ever
be
the
same
after
encountering
physical
people
in
the
midst
of
their
suffering.</p
