about
how

this

how
does
eating
healthy
meals
benefit
students?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong
prof.
slavin
children
need
nutritious
food
and
beverages
in
order
to
be
successful
in
the
classroom
good
nutrition
not
only
maximizes
students
ability
to
think
well
its
essential
for
strong
movement
in
gym
class
recess
and
sports
kids
need
to
consume
high
quality
protein
three
times
day
and
variety
of
whole
grains
legumes
vegetables
and
fruits
these
foods
can
help
ensure
students
are
getting
important
nutrients
including
dietary
fiber
and
potassium
understand
that
food
is
only
nutritious
if
it
is
consumed
so
make
sure
that
available
food
and
beverages
do
nt
end
up
in
the
trash
meals
and
snacks
can
be
tailored
to
accommodate
children
with
special
needs
food
allergies
or
cultural
preferences
nbsp;<br><br><strong
what
components
make
for
nutritious
packed
lunch
or
school
snack?&nbsp;<br
prof.
slavin
you
might
be
surprised
to
learn
that
packaged
snack
foods
continue
to
improve
their
nutrients
there
are
now
more
options
that
include
whole
grains
fruits
vegetables
and
isolated
proteins
most
packed
lunches
and
school
snacks
do
still
include
ultra
processed
foods
despite
recent
push
to
limit
these
items
parents
should
know
that
perfectly
healthy
lunch
could
include
peanut
butter
sandwich
whole
grain
chips
fruit
or
vegetable
snack
and
dairy
beverage
or
alternative
dairy
beverage
that
is
shelf
stable
and
rich
in
vitamin
and
calcium
focusing
on
the
recommendations
on
myplate.gov
can
set
students
and
parents
up
for
success.&nbsp;<br><br><strong
how
can
encourage
my
kids
to
make
smart
choices
in
the
cafeteria
line?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong
prof.
slavin
if
your
child
is
eating
school
lunch
you
can
feel
confident
they
will
have
healthy
options
provided
meals
stick
to
the
dietary
guidelines
for
americans
including
limits
on
added
sugars
solid
fats
and
sodium
additionally
eating
school
lunch
could
also
help
students
develop
more
varied
palette
firstly
school
lunch
can
introduce
children
to
protein
sources
vegetables
fruits
grains
and
legumes
that
may
be
unfamiliar
studies
find
that
it
can
take
more
than
exposures
to
vegetable
before
child
may
try
it
and
like
it
school
lunch
offers
this
repeat
exposure
secondly
seeing
other
children
enjoy
vegetables
and
whole
grain
products
can
make
it
more
likely
that
your
child
will
choose
vegetable
they
are
not
familiar
with
or
pizza
with
whole
grain
crust
nbsp;<br><br><strong
back
to
school
is
busy
time
do
you
have
any
advice
for
easily
upping
the
nutrition
in
quick
weeknight
meals?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong
prof.
slavin
back
to
school
is
such
an
exciting
yet
busy
time
seems
like
dinner
is
difficult
as
everyone
is
tired
after
work
school
sports
music
religious
activities
and
more
key
part
of
preparing
the
evening
meal
is
having
plan
using
slow
cookers
so
dinner
is
ready
when
everyone
returns
from
long
day
can
be
lifesaver
many
cultural
eating
patterns
and
popular
meal
choices
including
casseroles
stir
fry
soups
salads
pizzas
and
tortillas
can
be
improved
by
reducing
sodium
added
sugars
and
solid
fats
and
increasing
whole
grains
vegetables
fruits
and
legumes
healthy
meal
options
available
at
grocery
stores
and
restaurants
may
work
best
for
family
who
needs
to
work
around
soccer
or
band
practice
the
most
important
thing
is
to
gather
as
family
and
enjoy
breaking
bread
together
while
following
guidelines
for
better
nutrition
moderation
and
variety.</p><p><strong
