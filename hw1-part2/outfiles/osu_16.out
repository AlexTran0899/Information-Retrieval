the

is
the

primary
fundraising

organization
it
was
founded
in
as
non

tax

organization
that
advances
the
mission
of
ohio
state
by
pursuing
and
securing
private
support
to

the
ohio

university
enjoys
robust
history
of
private

from
its

the
fundraising
results
of
almost
three
decades
combined
with
an
understanding
of
the
environment
in
which
those
results
were
achieved
provide
the
context
and
background
from
which
the
current
operation
staffing
model
strategic
direction
and
opportunities
flow.</p><p
the
first
focused
campaign
at
ohio
state
raised
approximately
million
to
help
build
ohio

which
was
dedicated

was
institutionalized
years
later
when
the
board

more
than
3,300

the

goal
was
later
raised
to

when

ended
in

the
largest
campaign
in
ohio
states
history
more
than
750,000
alumni
and
friends
contributed
to
the
campaign
the
campaign
allowed
ohio
state
to
implement
visionary
new
ideas
for
the
student
experience
and
to
use
our
breadth
of
disciplines
to

complex

also
the
largest
in

history
with

given
the
rising
cost
of
academic
excellence
and
the
decline
in
state
support
of
college
and
university
budgets
private
support
will
be
critical
to
higher
education
in
the
21st
century
ohio
state
is
no
exception
as
the
state
of
ohio
is
allocating
only
percent
of
its
annual
budget
to
higher
education
which
is
attributable
in
part
to
decrease
in
federal
funding.</p><p
