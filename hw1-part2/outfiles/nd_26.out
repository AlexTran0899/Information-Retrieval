were
measuring

pierattini
an

created
research
team
called
the

isha
lab
to
prove
that
the
toumba
building
is
in
fact
the
earliest
known
structure
in
greece
that
led
centuries
later
to
the
prominent
columns
of
the
classical
greek
temple.</p
to
picture
this
iconic
style
think
of
the
in

and
its
central
shrine
and
statue
with
row
of
columns
all
around
it
the

is

famous

ruins
in

greece.</p
but
why
test
model
of
the
toumba
building
for
wind
loads
and
stability?</p
pierattini
said
there
has
been
long
standing
question
of
who
invented
the
idea
of
building
temple
with
columns
all
around
it
what
is
called
the
peristyle
that
characterizes
classical
architecture
some
have
hypothesized
that
the
greeks
learned
the
concept
from
similar
temples
in
egypt
thousands
of
years
earlier.</p

while
few
traces
remained

the

building
discovered
in

coulton
used
evidence
of
post
holes
around
the
perimeter
to
establish
it
as
the
earliest
known
local
antecedent
of
the
peristyle
of
later
greek
temples.</p
at
more
than
feet
long
and
feet
wide
the
structure
is
times
larger
than
other
known
buildings
from
this
period
archaeologists
believe
it
was
used
as
wealthy
couples
home
before
becoming
their
burial
site
including
jewelry
and
sacrificed
horses.</p
because
the
toumba
building
dates
back
to
the
10th
century
b.c.
experts
believe
it
could
not
have
been
copied
from
egyptian
temples
while
there
is
evidence
of
contact
between
the
earlier
bronze
age
egyptians
and
greeks
none
is
found
during
what
was
called
the
greek
dark

b.c.
and

in

scholars
widely
accepted
that
this
gap
proved
that
the
greeks
did
not
copy
the
peristyle
from
egypt
the
toumba
building
was
the
missing
link
proving
the
greeks
developed
the
classical
style
on
their
own.</p
until
that
when
architectural
historian
georg
herdt
published
study
questioning
the
evidence
of
peristyle
based
on
structural
analysis
of
the
toumba
building
herdt
determined
that
the
interior
posts
could
not
have
supported
the
height
coulton
calculated
and
that
the
exterior
posts
could
have
been
from
surrounding
fence.</p
debate
has
divided
the
field
since.</p

two

pierattini
put
together
the
isha
lab
to
resolve
this
debate
it
includes
aerospace
research
professor
structural
engineering
professors
and
and
an
external
collaborator
from
the
university
of
illinois
and
argonne
national
laboratory.</p
the
team
re
evaluated
herdts
structural
analysis
which
did
not
include
wind
loads.</p
3D

of
the

they

about

long

of

supported

wind

increasing
the

at

to
determine
the

the

fytanidis
plugged
this
experimental
data
into
numerical
model
to
determine
what
wind
loads
the
building
could
withstand.</p
then
the
structural
engineers
assessed
the
structural
behavior
of
different
variables
such
as
whether
the
wooden
posts
were
latched
together
with
ropes
and
whether
the
walls
were
wood
or
adobe
bricks
they
developed
different
estimates
from
worst-
to
best
case
scenarios.</p

considering
both
wind
and
the
load
of

it
turned
out
to
be
more
than
stable
pierattini
said
surprisingly
even
by
modern
standards
this
building
was
really
well
designed
it
was
certainly
stable
even
to
relatively
strong
winds
so
our
experimental
and
numerical
data
demonstrated
this
building
does
deserve
its
place
in
every
book
of
greek
architecture.</p
pierattini
believes
the
structural
data
backs
up
what
coulton
proposed
about
the
alignment
of
the
postholes
the
outer
and
inner
postholes
form
straight
lines
that
suggest
peristyle
connections.</p
the
isha
team
presented
preliminary
data
to
an
international
group
of
experts
in
an
online
in
may
pierattini
said
more
refined
data
will
be
presented
at
future
meeting
of
the
archaeological
institute
of
america
and
he
is
working
on
an
article
he
hopes
to
publish
next
year
in
the
peer
reviewed
annual
of
the
british
school
at
athens
top
journal
from
cambridge
university.</p
im
the
author
so
obviously
biased
but
think
this
will
answer
the
question
of
whether
this
is
the
first
known
peripteral
building
in
greek
history
once
it
is
published
pierattini
said
its
also
interesting
because
we
need
to
develop
common
interdisciplinary
language
between
architects
physicists
and
engineers
imagine
it
will
be
very
visual.</p
