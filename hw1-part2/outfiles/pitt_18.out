cool
oward
finally
declares
after
long
silence
seemingly
having
made
his
decision
but
giving
gundlach
no
indication
of
what
hell
do.</p
gundlach
is
unbothered
being
performance
engineer
is
as
much
about
psychology
as
it
is
about
mechanics
and
though
its
taken
time
she
reached
level
of
communication
with
oward
that
does
nt
always
require
words
she
can
decipher
his
body
language
and
silences
in
way
that
few
others
can
and
she
trusts
his
instincts
so
after
making
her
pitch
she
simply
follows
him
back
to
the
teams
track
cart
and
climbs
aboard
ready
to
continue
their
prerace
inspection
of
the
course.</p
just
let
pato
be

she
says
the
more
pato

the
better

are

oward
punches
the
gas
and

takes
off

lurch

was

he
knew
how
to
get
the
most
out
of
an

she
relished
the
days
she
got
to
follow
him
to
tracks
near
their
suburban

home
and
listen
to
him
explain
the
limits
and
possibilities
of
machinery
it
did
nt
take
long
before
she
too
became
captivated
by
anything
on
two
wheels.</p
as
gundlach
began
looking
at
colleges
and
considering
career
in
racing
her
father
tempered
that
infatuation
with
some
very

like
advice
think
there
more
money
in

she
made

not

four
years

she
tended

race
teams
employ
more
than
just
daredevil
drivers
each
team
also
enlists
to
engineers
to
generate
and
analyze
vast
amounts
of
data
including
speed
brake
pressure
throttle
percentage
and
even
steering
wheel
position
and
then
turn
those
numbers
into
ideas
and
simulations
that
will
make
the
car
perform
better
and
go
faster
if
you
re
looking
to
join
an
indycar
team
right
out
of
college
gundlach
says
you
better
be
high
achiever
with
stellar
grades
pitt
instilled
the
former
but
because
she
still
lacked
the
latter
gundlach
would
have
to
spend
her
early
days
toiling
in
racings
lower
ranks
so
while
her
former
classmates
were
taking
full
time
jobs
with
pittsburgh
based
companies
like
westinghouse
and
airgas
she
used
her
dads
connections
to
land
an
internship
with
small
race
team
out
of
trafford
pennsylvania.</p
it
was
nt
glamorous
my
first
desk
was
cardboard
box
but
it
gave
her
big
picture
view
of
the
motorsports
world
in
two
years
there
she
worked
alongside
mechanics
data
analysts
and
race
engineers
and
eventually
graduated
to
real
desk
she
even
got
to
participate
in
what
was
then
called
the
star
mazda
championship
an
open
wheel
racing
series
that
served
as
rung
on
the
ladder
to
the
big
leagues.</p
but
breaking
into
the
elite
ranks
of
auto
racing
is
nt
linear
process
its
as
much
about
what
you
know
as
it
is
about
who
you
know
and
when
you
know
them
fortunately
for
gundlach
she
happened
upon
the
right
person
mechanic
with
indycar
just
as
his
team
was
looking
for
data
engineer.</p
in
the
spring
of
she
joined
driver
simona
de
silvestros
team
at
hvm
racing
that
was
the
year
de
silvestro
piloted
the
green
and
white
no
car
with
what
turned
out
to
be
an
underpowered
lotus
engine
the
results
were
disappointing
de
silvestro
was
black
flagged
or
disqualified
from
multiple
races
for
not
maintaining
the
minimum
speed
and
finished
24th
in
the
series
standings.</p
it
ended
up
being
very
challenging
season
gundlach
says
but
it
was
character
building.</p
when
the
team
disbanded
at
the
end
of
the
season
gundlach
left
with
better
understanding
of
indycars
fickle
nature
while
that
kind
of
unpredictability
could
frustrate
purely
analytical
being
gundlach
is
an
artist
at
heart
she
loves
all
things
messy
and
creative
and
chaotic
her
homes
walls
are
painted
in
vibrant
oranges
and
purples
live
plants
cover
her
tables
and
dried
flowers
hang
from
the
rafters
she
lives
with
turtle
four
dogs
and
tanks
of
fish
the
uncertainty
of
racing
plays
to
her
strengths.</p
art
is
quite
an
intuitive
study
she
says
you
do
n't
know
all
the
answers
going
into
it
and
same
with
engineering
you
do
n't
know
you
're
given
tools
and
sometimes
the
tools
are
brand
new
so
you
do
n't
know
exactly
how
to
use
the
tools
and
you
re
trying
to
solve
problems
you
do
n't
know
the
answer
to
with
tools
you
do
n't
really
know
how
to
use
but
you
start
to
figure
it
out
you
ask
ok
what
does
my
gut
say?</p
she
took
that
artists
intuition
to
rahal
letterman
lanigan
racing
team
as
systems
engineer
in
and
year
later
to
series
stalwart
chip
ganassi
racing
as
an
assistant
engineer
it
was
there
that
she
won
her
first
ntt
indycar
series
title
with
driver
scott
dixon
making
her
and
teammate
danielle
shepherd
the
experience
was
shot
of
pure
adrenaline.</p
when
you
win
the
championship
you
feel
like
ve
finally
done
it
the
job
is
done
we
are
the
best
gundlach
says.</p
but
that
feeling
is
fleeting
each
new
year
and
each
new
race
brings
fresh
challenges
unexpected
obstacles
and
maddening
flukes
you
may
have
control
over
where
you
re
going
but
you
ll
never
be
able
to
predict
what
will
happen
once
you
get
there.</p
sometimes
you
win
the
championship
and
sometimes
you
drag
the

its

day
at
the
indianapolis
motor

and
oward
has
just
finished
an
anemic
eighth
in
the
first
practice
run
she
hops
down
from
the
timing
stand
in
the
pit
grabs
her
tablet
and
immediately
heads
for
the
arrow
mclaren
garage
she
surprisingly
fast
for
someone
who
stands
barely
five
feet
tall.</p
we
have
lot
of
work
to
do
in
two
hours
she
says.</p
thats
when
the
qualifying
race
that
will
determine
starting
position
for
the
gallagher
grand
prix
begins
she
still
hoping
oward
can
win
the
pole
and
if
he
doesnt?</p
id
take
third
but
nothing
less
she
says.</p
gundlachs
intensity
and
refusal
to
fail
is
change
from
her
early
days
in
indycar
back
then
she
stayed
quiet
afraid
asking
questions
or
offering
suggestions
would
reveal
an
inadequacy
or
weakness
its
taken
time
and
experience
to
overcome
the
imposter
syndrome
but
she
arrived
at
place
where
she
trusts
her
ability
to
dissect
and
solve
any
problem
that
faces
her
and
then
to
offer
her
unreserved
opinion.</p
fellow
engineer
calls
her
approach
very
thorough.</p
it
has
to
be
because
indycar
leaves
so
little
space
for
error
but
also
because
the
track
has
traditionally
functioned
as
boys
club
where
women
especially
women
engineers
are
novelty.</p
lauren
gaudion
the
director
of
communications
for
arrow
mclaren
counts
women
among
the
teams
or
so
employees
but
estimates
that
nearly
double
any
other
team
at
indycar
in
part
thanks
to
gundlach
she
made
it
her
responsibility
to
recruit
and
support
women
in
racing.</p
lizzie
todd
is
one
of
those
women
she
was
systems
engineer
for
andretti
autosport
when
gundlach
texted
her
about
an
opening
at
arrow
mclaren
though
it
was
technically
lateral
move
she
saw
it
as
step
up
both
because
arrow
mclaren
is
known
to
promote
from
within
and
because
she
would
get
to
work
alongside
gundlach
the
two
have
known
each
other
since
todd
joined
indycar
in
and
gundlach
adopted
her.</p
shes
phenomenal
todd
says
she
super
goal
oriented
she
knows
where
she
wants
to
go
she
knows
what
she
wants
to
be
but
she
also
so
willing
to
be
helpful
standing
next
to
her
on
the
timing
stand
has
changed
the
way
look
at
data
she
taught
me
different
ways
to
approach
things
which
has
made
me
more
efficient
and
allowed
me
to
take
on
more.</p
the
mentorship
is
even
more
remarkable
when
you
realize
gundlach
is
training
todd
to
reach
the
next
rung
on
the
indycar
engineering
ladder
which
just
happens
to
be
gundlachs
own
job.</p
women
have
different
set
of
expectations
and
different
pressures
on
them
gundlach
says
and
one
of
those
pressures
is
the
perception
that
you
are
not
in
control
that
you
do
n't
have
the
means
to
operate
at
that
level
that
you
need
someone
's
permission
to
do
that
've
suffered
through
that
quite
bit
see
lot
of
women
come
into
the
sport
and
'm
trying
to
communicate
this
to
them
so
that
they
do
nt
make
the
same
mistakes
did
and
maybe
they
can
accelerate
little
bit
faster.</p
gundlachs
career
acceleration
meanwhile
shows
no
signs
of
slowing
down
she
already
performance
engineer
she
leading
team
and
that
not
even
the
top
trajectory
of
her
career
gaudion
says.</p
gundlach
has
two
primary
goals
in
her
sights
the
first
is
to
become
race
engineer
the
pressure
filled
top
engineering
spot
on
the
team
responsible
for
working
alongside
the
driver
on
race
day
and
making
all
final
decisions
on
car
related
issues.</p
gundlachs
other
goal
is
to
win
the
sports
most
beloved
race
the
indianapolis
500.</p

really
proud

the
oward
teams
brickyard
weekend
has
ended
with
third
place
finish
in
the
gallagher
grand
prix
its
the
teams
seventh
top
five
finish
of
the
season
and
their
sixth
trip
to
the
podium
its
enough
to
move
oward
into
fifth
place
in
the
ntt
indycar
series
standings
but
it
just
barely
surpasses
gundlachs
self
imposed
minimum
standard.</p
winning
is
such
hard
thing
to
do
because
the
series
is
so
tight
she
says
everything
has
to
go
your
way
and
that
only
happens
once
in
blue
moon.</p
fortunately
gundlach
believes
owards
future
is
full
of
blue
moons.</p
on
clear
nights
as
she
leaving
the
garage
and
walking
to
her
car
she
tips
her
head
back
to
stare
into
starry
sky
and
imagines
what
it
might
be
like
to
watch
oward
take
the
podium
at
the
indianapolis
knowing
she
had
hand
in
getting
him
there.</p
she
may
even
take
celebratory
chug
of
milk
one
of
those
odd
and
endearing
indy
traditions
that
began
in
when
driver
louis
meyer
guzzled
bottle
of
buttermilk
in
victory
lane.</p
but
because
this
is
kate

have
to
do
it
her
own
way
of
course.</p
