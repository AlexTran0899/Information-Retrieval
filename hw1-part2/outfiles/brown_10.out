brown
university
new
study
that
explores
ancient
temperatures
and
rainfall
patterns
in
the
tropical
andes
of
south
america
has
revealed
how
16,000
years
of
climate
history
in
this
part
of
the
world
was
driven
by
carbon
dioxide
levels
and
ocean
currents
from
global
climate
events.</p
led
by
brown
university
researchers
the
study
marks
the
first
high
resolution
temperature
record
covering
the
past
16,000
years
in
the
tropical
andes
and
could
help
scientists
predict
and
mitigate
future
climate
impacts
in
tropical
regions
of
the
planet
the
work
is
in
the
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
science.</p
usually
when
we
study
climate
change
in
the
past
we
emphasize
the
northern
hemisphere
or
southern
hemisphere
because
of
the
outsized
role
they
play
in
affecting
climates
all
over
the
globe
said
boyang
zhao
scientist
in
browns
department
of
earth
environmental
and
planetary
sciences
and
the
studys
first
author
one
of
the
biggest
questions
we
are
getting
at
is
what
are
the
driving
factors
behind
temperature
history
in
this
part
of
the
tropics
so
that
we
can
begin
to
potentially
apply
that
data
and
knowledge
to
other
tropical
regions.</p
along
with
future
implications
the
new
study
provides
unique
look
at
the
way
distinct
and
distant
parts
of
the
world
influence
temperature
and
weather
elsewhere
emphasizing
how
regional
climates
are
connected
to
global
climate
changes.</p
our
evidence
here
suggests
that
temperatures
in
this
region
of
the
world
are
more
influenced
by
the
southern
hemisphere
so
places
like
antarctica
zhao
said.</p
the
study
focused
on
an
analysis
of
sediment
samples
from
laguna
llaviucu
lake
located
in
ecuadors
cajas
national
park
the
measurements
from
the
sediment
samples
showed
that
temperature
variations
in
the
tropical
andes
closely
aligned
with
climate
events
that
saw
the
planets
temperatures
rise
and
fall
during
the
past
16,000
years.</p
overall
the
evidence
showed
that
the
main
driver
in
these
temperature
fluctuations
was
the
concentration
of
CO2
researchers
saw
evidence
that
the
tropical
andean
temperatures
track
with
antarctic
temperatures
which
are
mainly
controlled
by
carbon
dioxide
concentrations
the
findings
showed
that
about
17,000
to
14,000
years
ago
tropical
andean
temperatures
rose
when
carbon
dioxide
increased
and
that
the
temperatures
remained
relatively
stable
about
12,000
years
ago
when
carbon
dioxide
levels
remained
relatively
stable.</p
zhao
said
that
the
findings
support
previous
research
identifying
carbon
dioxide
as
key
driver
of
global
temperature
changes
since
the
last
ice
age.</p
the
study
also
highlighted
the
role
of
ocean
currents
that
move
warm
water
from
the
tropics
to
the
north
atlantic
during
cooling
period
known
as
the
antarctic
cold
reversal
14,500
years
ago
the
northward
current
was
strengthened
causing
it
to
transport
more
heat
northward
and
cool
sea
surface
temperatures
in
the
south
the
researchers
found
that
this
cooling
effect
extended
to
the
tropical
andes.</p
to
reconstruct
past
climate
conditions
the
researchers
analyzed
lipid
biomarkers
and
hydrogen
isotopes
collected
in
from
laguna
llaviucu
by
scientist
mark
bush
from
the
florida
institute
of
technology
lipid
biomarkers
are
chemical
compounds
that
provide
clues
about
past
temperatures
and
rainfall
patterns
the
high
resolution
data
combined
with
accurate
dating
techniques
allowed
the
team
to
create
detailed
timeline
of
climate
changes
over
the
past
16,000
years.</p
according
to
the
researchers
this
is
the
first
time
organic
biomarkers
have
been
used
to
put
together
quantitative
climate
history
for
tropical
south
america
it
is
traditionally
difficult
to
reconstruct
temperatures
from
the
tropics.</p
the
study
also
points
out
number
of
regional
differences
in
temperature
patterns
like
how
the
tropical
andes
and
southeast
asia
cooled
during
certain
historical
periods
while
other
regions
like
africa
did
not.<strong
the
research
also
shows
how
local
factors
may
help
to
counteract
the
global
effects
of
rising
CO2
levels
by
looking
at
differences
between
past
temperature
models
and
what
the
sediment
data
show.</p
the
researchers
from
brown
plan
to
continue
to
explore
past
temperature
patterns
in
this
part
of
the
world
that
historically
lacks
complete
climate
records.</p
mountain

some
of

sensitive
