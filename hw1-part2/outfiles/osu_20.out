what
is
employee
giving
ohio
states
year
round
employee
giving
program
that
is
replacing
campus
campaign
our
goal
is
to
create
culture
of
philanthropy
connecting
you
to
the
people
and
programs
that
you
are
most
passionate
about
as
well
as
education
and
advocacy
to
promote
consistency
and
familiarity
tailored
for
our
faculty
and
staff
this
is
an
easy
way
of
making
sure
your
support
goes
further
than
ever
before.</p
why
is
employee
giving
so
important
to
ohio
state
support
from
employees
provide
funding
for
important
initiatives
on
all
of
ohio
states
campuses
employees
who
participate
are
an
endorsement
of
the
university
announcing
to
alumni
friends
patients
corporations
and
foundations
that
ohio
state
is
an
institution
worthy
of
support.</p><p
government
funding
covers
only
fraction
of
the
costs
associated
with
running
such
large
university
and
providing
services
to
the
thousands
of
students
and
patients
we
work
with
on
daily
basis.</p
is
this
the
same
as
campus
campaign
no.</p
so
employee
giving
has
replaced
campus
campaign
yes
your
financial
support
any
time
of
the
year
to
any
cause
at
ohio
state
will
count
towards
participation
to
the
employee
giving
campaign.</p
not
everyone
can
afford
to
make
large
contribution
what
difference
could
small
gift
make
every
gift
is
important
whatever
the
amount
your
gift
shows
that
you
believe
in
the
cause
you
have
chosen
to
support
there
are
many
causes
that
receive
larger
number
of
small
gifts.</p><p
we
encourage
you
to
consider
giving
by
payroll
deduction
while
all
it
takes
to
participate
is
gift
of
per
pay
to
the
cause
of
your
choice
shows
your
commitment
to
the
success
of
the
program
research
patient

initiative

you
choose
