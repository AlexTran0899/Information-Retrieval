often
have
to
use
large

it

not

reactions

reported
in

august
issue

caltech
chemists
have
succeeded
in
solving
this
scaling
up
riddle
their
solution
allows
the
samarium
diiodide
reagent
to
essentially
recycle
itself
for
repeated
use
in
single
reaction
which
means
large
amounts
of
solvents
and
fresh
preparations
are
no
longer
needed.</p><p

key="4dfsq">"Samarium
diiodide
has
been
used
in
academia
for
the
synthesis
of
natural
products
like
taxol
an
anticancer
agent
but
the
reagent
is
not
practical
for
creating
products
like
this
on
industrial
scales
says
reisman
the
breakthrough
is
that
now
we
can
translate
some
of
these
interesting
reactions
into
process
development
or
discovery
"</p><p
data

key="ae5p0">The
samarium
reagent
has
been
limited
to
lab
use
due
to
pesky
samariumoxygen
bond
that
forms
during
the
reactions
and
renders
the
chemical
inactive.</p><p
data

key="vhfq">"it
's
been
very
difficult
to
recycle
samarium
back
to
its
active
state
until
now

works

reagent
often
ends
up
with
very
strong
samarium

is
hard

the
reagent
she
says.</p><p
data

key="ij7v">In
other
words
the
oxygen
bond
leads
to
dead
end
for
the

it
's
like

samarium

lazy
sitting

's
very
comfortable
in
this

to
stay
that
way
boyd
says
so
we
experimented
with
different
acids
to
cleave
the
samarium
oxygen
bond
and
get
the
reagent
back
to
work
"</p><p
data
block
key="b5jik">Previous
attempts
to
break
this
samariumoxygen
bond
have
required
the
use

harsh

in

new
study
the
researchers
were
able
to
cleave
the
bond
using
mild
acid
which
is
more
practical
for
large
scale
reactions
the
acid
supplies
proton
to
the
bound
oxygen
which
turns
it
into
an
alcohol
and
frees
up
the
samarium.</p><p

this
