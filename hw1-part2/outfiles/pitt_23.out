tools
for
mastering
the
complex
are
math
beautiful

because
there
exist
right
and
wrong
answers
and
repetition.</p
at
years
old
those
tools
afforded
her
the
ability
to
take
apart
and
rebuild
computers
as
university
of
pittsburgh
fifth
year
industrial
engineering
major
that
learning
strategy
means
allocating
two
to
three
hours
outside
of
homework
to
complete
practice
problems.</p
have
to
do
lot
of
repetition
to
understand
processes
joynes
said
ca
n't
accept
this
is
how
we
do
it
or
just
because
need
to
understand
how
we
got
to
this
part
all
the
steps
in
between
and
the
outcome.</p
there
was
at
least
one</em
moment
in
her
life
when
the
solution
was
simple
in
when
she
determined
pitt
was
her
place
her
parents
alan
j.
joynes
a&amp;s
and
bridget
major
joynes
nurs
and
uncle
marcellus
major
jr.
engr
only
partly
influenced
the
claymont
delaware
native
's
decision
to
attend
the
determining
factor
she
said
was
comprehensive
undergraduate
diversity
program
within
the
swanson
school
of
engineering
committed
to
the
success
of
historically
underrepresented
engineering
scholars.</p
after
meeting
pitt
excels
director
yvette
moore
and
realizing
other
schools
did
n't
offer
the
same
level
of
commitment
to
students
of
color
who
are
pursuing
the
rigorous
major
at
predominantly
white
institution
joynes
told
her
family
have
to
get
into
pitt
and
have
to
get
into
swanson
and
she
did.</p
it
was
the
perfect
fit
for
me
joynes
said.</p
pitt
excel
provides
participants
with
mentoring
advising
access
to
an
extensive
alumni
network
and
according
to
joynes
an
extended
family.</p
view
pitt
excel
as
family
says
director
moore
who
's
worked
in
swanson
since
and
credits
the
program
with
impacting
well
over
1,400
students
its
place
where
you
can
be
challenged
be
yourself
and
find
like
minded
and
different
people
people
often
look
at
diversity
program
students
as
less
than
others
and
we
promote
our
students
as
more
than
were
dealing
with
young
creators
that
will
go
on
to
do
better
than
we
can
even
dream.</p
students
accepted
into

begin
taking
accelerated
classes
the
summer
before
their
first
semester
to
encourage
team
building
help
them
acclimate
to
campus
and
coursework
and
reveal
their
skills
and
improvement

moore

her

customize
academic

sure

race

and
more.</p
we
get
to
know
the
scholar
to
understand
how
they
will
perform
in
these
classes
she
said.</p
this
hands
on
approach
along
with
meeting
program
alumni
instilled
excitement
pride
and
confidence
in
joynes
can
do
this
because
they
made
it
through
she
said.</p
but
moore
said
joynes
has
done
more
than
just
make
it
through
she
's
epitomized
the
idea
of
the
holistic
scholar
evidenced
by
her
many
accomplishments
including
an
extended
co
op
with
fedex
that
lasted
two
years
double
the
typical
rotation.</p
joynes
joined
the
shipping
and
transportation
giant
's
linehaul
engineering
department
in
generating
weekly
data
reports
focused
on
the
logistics
and
analytics
behind
trailer
transport
she
quickly
learned
the
internal
dashboards
and
was
given
increasing
access
and
responsibility
in
her
final
rotation
she
discovered
data
was
n't
being
transferred
from
scanners
to
the
system
significant
issue
impacting
reports
for
trailers
and
package
deliveries.</p
moore
was
nt
surprised
by
joynes
success.</p
great
industrial
engineer
is
keyed
in
on
how
you
optimize
situations
industries
systems
and
that
anaya
says
moore
she
an
intellect
extraordinaire
with
great
charm
caring
leader
who
does
nt
have
problem
pushing
the
envelope
the
tone
of
pitt
is
set
by
looking
at
her
this
is
where
we
should
be
going
as
engineers
as
women
as
black
women
it
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
what
she
can
do
she
is
our
future
she
is
the
standard
of
what
we
want
scholar
to
be.</p

kind
of
followed
her
positions
said
brown
who
took
up
joynes
mantle
as
nsbe
president
she
always
pushed
me
and
helped
me
realize
what
my
goals
could
be
in
position.</p
joining
pitt
excel
and
heeding
joynes
advice
aided
brown
with
landing
competitive
internship
with
industry
innovator
pratt
and
whitney
and
job
with
general
electric
in
cincinnati
ohio
following

her
advice
helped
me
keep
taking
steps
up
within
leadership
brown
said
her
goals
the
things
she
said
that
kind
of
set
the
bar.</p
long
standing
legacy</h2
the
struggles
that
accompany
engineering
and
balancing
extracurriculars
like
blue
and
gold
society
and
delta
sigma
theta
sorority
inc.
have
been
the
most
rewarding
aspect
of
the
pitt
journey
for
joynes.</p
representing
that
you
can
be
black
woman
in
difficult
major
but
still
be
involved
on
campus
is
something
wanted
to
show
light
to
joynes
said
wanted
to
prove
you
can
leave
benedum
and
see
what
the
rest
of
campus
has
to
offer
because
engineering
is
your
major
not
your
personality
there
so
much
you
could
do
if
you
want
to
love
it
here.</p
