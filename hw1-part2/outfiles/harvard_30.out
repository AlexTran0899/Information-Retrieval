charles
sprague
sargent
officially
began
year
term
as
first
director
of
the
arnold
arboretum
sargent
soon
enlisted
the
aid
of
pioneering
landscape
architect
frederick
law
olmsted
then
busy
designing
the
boston
park
system
to
help
him
lay
out
the
grounds
olmsted
immediately
grasped
the
idea
that
an
arboretum
where
the
public
could
see
varied
plantations
of
rare
and
exotic
trees
and
shrubs
skilfully
sic
selected
artistically
arranged
and
grown
under
scientific
oversight
would
not
only
be
an
appropriate
feature
in
the
park
system
now
known
as
bostons
emerald
necklace
but
might
well
become
its
culminating
attraction

asa

professor

wrote
in

nonetheless
the
arboretum
proved
hard
sell
robinson
noted
neither
the
city
of
boston
nor
the
harvard
corporation
welcomed
the
idea
the
press
was
indifferent
and
the
public
apathetic
nine
years
of
persistent
effort
were
required
before
it
was
possible
to
draft
plan
of
procedure
acceptable
both
to
the
city
and
to

to
