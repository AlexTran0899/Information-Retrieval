the

of

was
among

with

during

academic
colloquiums.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p
an
expert
on
the
history
of
science
gordin
discussed
his
book
on
the
fringe
where
science
meets
pseudoscience.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p
it
is
really
hard
problem
to
decide
what
counts
as
science
and
what
counts
as
pseudoscience
he
said
understanding
why
its
hard
is
an
interesting
tour
of
multiple
disciplines
the
humanities
the
sciences
philosophy.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p
these
questions
can
also
apply
more
broadly
he
noted
the
goal
of
university
is
about
distinguishing
between
credible
and
non
credible
knowledge
that
is
why
you
are
here
gordin
told

the

both

the

you

right
that

she
still
feels

kim
said
its
much
more

realistic
picture
we
