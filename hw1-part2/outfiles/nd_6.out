every

absorb

Solution</h2
his

the
national

foundation
is
testing
the
idea
of
replacing

cell

with
multiple
transmitters
at

Ahead</h2
while

current
generation

phones
comply
with
sar
limits
hochwald
said
newer
phones
with
more
features
are
constantly
pushing
toward
the
edge
some
manufacturers
have
already
had
to
artificially
lower
phone
performance
to
meet
sar
requirements
and
the
next
generations
of
phones
including
eventually
phones
at
higher
frequencies
will
absolutely
have
to
find
creative
ways
to
limit
human
exposure
to
electromagnetic
radiation
to
reach
their
full
potential.</p
