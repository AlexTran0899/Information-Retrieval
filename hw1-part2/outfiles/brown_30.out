brown
researchers
have
lot
to
offer
the
nation
when
it
comes
to
basic
and
applied
research
including
areas
where
national

are
eager
to
engage
with
the

to
hear
about
their
workforce
development
needs
pipher
said
the
meeting
highlighted
current
partnerships
between
brown
and
the
national
labs
and
provided
an
excellent
opportunity
for
our
research
community
to
learn
more
about
potential
partnerships
with
national
labs
by
better
understanding
their
needs
and
priorities
"</p
at

current
and
past
collaborations

have
included

touched
on

of
these
topics
including
quantum
materials
energy
research
computational

and
the
study
of

under
extreme
conditions
many
presenters
from

discussed
the

at
the
opening
panel
on
quantum

for
instance
mark

and
mark
dean
from

spoke
about
their
work
career
paths
research
collaborations
and
instruments
available
at

researchers
likes

theres
an

dean
said
during
the
panel.</p
another
panel
focused
exclusively
on
best
practices
for
research
collaborations
and
how
university
and
national
laboratories
can
initiate
optimize
and
sustain
research
collaborations
suggestions
from
panelists
and
audience
members
included
exploring
internships
visiting
faculty
programs
and
joint
appointments
with
national

such
as
ones

the
themes
for
the
day
were
chosen
not
only
because
they
are
major
areas
of
research
excellence
at
brown
but
also
because
they
are
important
challenges
to
address
in
our
society
said
tejal
desai
dean
of
browns
school
of
engineering
as
community
we
approach
these
topics
and
areas
from
number
of
different
perspectives
and
we
think
that
by
bringing
together
our
expertise
and
really
collaborating
with
the
does
labs
across
the
nation
we
can
amplify
our
impact
in
ways
that
previously
have
n't
been
done
and
make
those
leaps
to
uncover
new
discoveries
that
are
able
to
translate
into
real
technologies
and
solutions.</p

are
an
outgrowth
of
immense
investment
in
scientific
research
initiated
by
the
u.s.
government
during

war
ii
for
more
than
years
the
labs
have
been
at
the
forefront
of
scientific
innovation
in
the
u.s.
confronting
some
of
the
most
critical
scientific
challenges
facing
the
nation
and
the
world
from
combating
climate
change
to
studying
the
origins
of
the
universe
or
how
atoms
work
at
their
smallest
levels.</p
throughout
that
history
collaboration
with
research
institutions
like
brown
has
been
essential
to
their
continued
success
that
no
different
today.</p
from
the
laboratories
point
of
view
collaborations
with

are
important
to
delivering
