pine

contributors

air
pollution
they

many

the
biogenic
particles
formed
from
pine
tree
emissions
are
much
more
chemically
interesting

dynamic
than
previously
thought
the
study
provides
the

transformed

graphics
software
usually
represents
dynamic
objects
such
as
an
expressive
face
as
sequence
of
shapes
with
each
shape
composed
of
set
of
points
in
space
another
way
to
model
an
expressive
face
is
to
chart
each
point
on
the
face
as
it
shifts
location
over
time
each
method
has
its
advantages
but
the
sheer
number
of
possible
variations
is
tremendous
which
results
in
models
that
are
large
and
difficult
to
manage
new
way
of
modeling
these
dynamic
objects
could
greatly
simplify
this
editing
process.</span
