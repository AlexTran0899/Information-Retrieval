antibiotics
revolutionized
medicine
but
even
these
lifesaving
medications
have
their
limits
in
two
new
studies
involving
university
of
pittsburgh
biologists
researchers
show
that
an
experimental
technique
using
bacteria
killing
viruses
successfully
treated
two
patients
with
deadly
infections
that
were
unresponsive
to
antibiotics
one
case
study
is
anecdotal

bacteriophages
phages
for
short
kill
bacteria
by
injecting
their
dna
into
bacterial
cells
and
turning
their
targets
into
phage
factories
harmless
to
humans
that
ability
has
made
phages
candidate
for
treating
some
otherwise
intractable
infections
including
those
caused
by
mycobacterium
abscessus
species
of
bacteria
that
notoriously
resistant
to
antibiotics
and
can
be
deadly
to
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
or
who
are
on
drugs
that
suppress
their
immune
systems
hatfull
and
his
lab
in
the
first
use
of
phages
to
treat
mycobacterium
infection
and
the
first
use
of
genetically
engineered
phages
in
such
treatment
they
re
now
on
path
toward
helping
more
patients
who
have
reached
the
limits
of
what
established
medicine
can
provide
you
have
to
have
exhausted
all
of
those
options
from
regulatory
point
of
view
before
you
can
go
to
something
truly
experimental

in
researchers
report
that
the
hatfull
labs
phage
therapy
was
successful
on
another
much
more
common
infection
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
disease
that
causes
buildups
of
mucus
in
the
lungs
among
other
catastrophic
effects
the
success
of
the
study
shows
that
phage
therapy
may
be
useful
for
many
more
cystic
fibrosis
patients
potentially
helping
others
who
are
stuck
on
transplant
waitlists
due
to
stubborn
mycobacterial
infections
in
the
lungs
but
the
treatments
success
was
anything
but
certain
performing
phage
therapy
on
patient
with
lung
infection
rather
than
skin
infection
like
in
the
paper
brought
with
it
new
set
of
challenges
and
questions
if
there
bacteria
in
the
bloodstream
and
you
give
phage
iv
you
ve
got
pretty
good
chance
that
those
two
will
find
each
other
hatfull
said
the
lungs
however
are
complicated
network
of
tubes
where
an
infection
can
hide
its
just
big
unknown
essentially.</span></span></span></p
thats
especially
true
in
patients
like
jarrod
johnson
at
the
center
of
the
new
paper
johnson
s</a
infection
persisted
even
after
years
of
treatment
with
antibiotics
after
phage
therapy
however
he
tested
negative
for
the
infection
more
than
dozen
times
clearing
the
way
for
him
to
receive
lung
transplant
am
so
grateful
for
the
effort
persistence
and
creativity
of
all
the
people
who
were
involved
in
my
treatment
said
johnson
thought
was
going
to
die
they
have
literally
saved
my
life
the
work
was
carried
out
by
physicians
at
national
jewish
health
in
denver
colorado
and
led
by
jerry
nick
who
sent
samples
to
hatfulls
lab
to
seek
phages
that
could
tackle
the
infection
weve
got
large
collection
of
phages
and
we
ve
sequenced
over
4,000
of
their
genomes
so
we
understand
their
genomic
profiles
and
relationships
in
exquisite
detail
hatfull
said
plus
we
have
information
about
which
bacteria
are
infected
by
which
phages
which
means
that
we
can
take
intelligent
guesses
as
to
which
are
going
to
be
the
most
useful
types
of
phages
to
look
for.</span></span></span></p
when
they
received
the
request
hatfull
and
his
lab
were
able
to
identify
two
phages
that
matched
up
with
the
strain
of
mycobacterium
abscessus
in
johnsons
lungs
and
genetically
engineer
them
to
be
more
effective
at
killing
it
as
with
any
case
study
its
impossible
to
be
sure
that
the
patients
recovery
was
result
of
the
treatment
but
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
stronger
than
most
hatfull
said
the
patient
has
been
followed
incredibly
carefully
clinically
for
years
with
multiple
sequencing
of
strains
and
antibiotic
profiles
he
said
especially
convincing
were
molecular
signals
of
parts
of
the
bacterias
cell
wall
in
the
patients
urine
sign
that
the
phages
were
killing
the
bacteria
and
doing
their
job.</span></span></span></p

from
cocktail
to
straight
shot
in
the
second
of
the
two
studies
the
pitt
team
along
with
colleagues
at
harvard
university
led
by
jessica
little
showed
success
in
treating
an
immunocompromised
patient
with
mycobacterial
skin
infection.</span></span></span></p
the
therapy
seemed
to
really
make
big
difference
when
the
antibiotics
really
had
nt
done
much
for
long
period
of
time
said
hatfull.</span></span></span></p
its
the
first
instance
of
phage
therapy
used
to
treat
an
infection
by
mycobacterium
chelonae
related
but
different
species
from
the
bacteria
previously
treated
with
phages
and
while
the
patients
immune
system
seemed
to
mount
an
attack
against
the
phage
it
did
nt
stop
the
treatment
from
being
effective.</span></span></span></p
yet
another
novel
aspect
of
the
study
was
the
phage
the
researchers
used.</span></span></span></p
researchers
worry
about
the
potential
for
bacteria
to
evolve
resistance
to
viruses
delivering
cocktail
of
multiple
phages
is
how
hatfulls
team
previously
attempted
to
avoid
the
problem
barrage
bacterial
infection
with
three
kinds
of
viruses
at
the
same
time
and
its
less
likely
to
be
able
to
out
evolve
them
but
when
the
team
tested
phages
against
this
patients
infection
only
one
turned
out
to
be
effective
muddy
one
of
the
three
used
in
the
study
thats
all
that
we
had
we
used
all
of
the
phages
that
were
available
hatfull
said
we
obviously
ran
the
risk
that
we
would
see
resistance
and
failure
but
it
was
either
that
or
do
nothing.</span></span></span></p
the
fact
that
the
bacteria
did
nt
evolve
resistance
to
the
single
phage
came
as
surprise
and
it
also
opens
up
new
potential
for
treating
patients
especially
for
those
with
robust
immune
system.</span></span></span></p
now
we
can
contemplate
giving
them
phage
number
one
for
month
and
then
well
stop
then
give
them
phage
number
two
for
month
and
then
stop
hatfull
said
doing
so
would
lessen
the
risk
of
the
patients
immune
system
attacking
the
phages.</span></span></span></p
taken
together
the
two
studies
point
toward
future
for
phage
therapy
for
broader
array
of
mycobacterium
infections
and
new
potential
ways
to
maximize
the
therapys
chance
of
success.</span></span></span></p

however
is
just
one
component
of

work
at

the

is
continuing

into
what
makes

we
now
have
big
broad

of

of

and
some

hatfull
said
this
is
huge
resource
for
understanding
basic
biology.</span></span></span></p
in
that
library
of
samples
hatfull
and
his
lab
have
found
surprising
new
place
to
look
for
candidate
phages
to
enlist
in
the
fight
against
mycobacterium
infections
hidden
in
the
dna
of
these
bacteria
are
the
full
genetic
material
of
phages
that
infected
those
cells
in
the
past
their
existence
is
proof
that
the
phage
can
infect
those
bacteria
and
the
lab
is
now
able
to
use
these
blueprints
to
bring
these
viruses
to
life
the
next
step
is
to
tweak
their
dna
so
they
can
not
only
infect
those
mycobacterium
strains
but
reliably
kill
them
too
were
still
working
on
how
to
engineer
them
and
how
to
get
them
into
therapy
said
hatfull
we
have
nt
used
any
of
them
therapeutically
yet
but
think
were
getting
close.</span></span></span></p
and
continuing
research
on
which
phages
infect
which
mycobacterium
strains
and
why
could
impact
treatments
in
the
future
at
the
heart
of
that
question
is
the
potential
to
move
beyond

and
labor
intensive

approach
to
more

assessments
when
mycobacterium
sample
arrives
as
for
their
clinical
work
the
lab
expects
to
soon
publish
reports
of
more
case
studies
moving
past
proof
of
concept
and
developing
more
robust
body
of
knowledge
about
phage
therapy
for
mycobacterium
infections
the
kind
that
essential
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
potential
clinical
trial
where
the
therapy
could
be
tested
in
more
rigorous
way
we
need
clinical
trials
and
we
are
n't
going
to
get
there
until
we
have
some
information
about
each
of
these
steps
said
dedrick
wherever
the
field
goes
next
its
all
but
certain
that
the
lab
will
be
at
the
center
of
it
when
it
comes
to
people
who
work
on
phages
that
could
be
used
for
mycobacterial
diseases
we
are
it
basically
said
hatfull
you
ca
nt
get
this
from
any
other
lab
in
the
world</a
think
its
fair
to
say.</span></span></span></p
