broad
concept
that
includes
differences
in
society&#8217;s
opportunities
the
shaping
of
social
institutions
by
different
social
factors
the
formation
of
group
and
individual
identity
and
the
processes
of
social
change
this
includes
race
class
age
nationality
sexual
orientation
gender
identity
and
expression
religion
disability
language
and
region
of
residence
among
others.</span></p
equity
occurs
when
all
people
or
groups
in
community
are
given
access
to
the
correct
number
and
types
of
resources
that
enable
them
to
achieve
equal
results
equity
differs
from
equality
which
focuses
on
the
equal
distribution
of
resources
rather
than
on
equal
results.</span></p
the
notion
that
an
organization
or
system
is
welcoming
to
new
populations
and/or
identities
each
new
presence
is
not
merely
tolerated
but
expected
to
contribute
meaningfully
to
the
system
in
positive
mutually
beneficial
way
inclusive
processes
and
practices
strive
to
bring
groups
together
to
make
decisions
in
collaborative
mutual
and
equitable
ways.</span></span></p
mutual
power
access
and
opportunity
among
all
groups
and
individuals
within
shared
community
such
as
society
organization
club
etc
operationalizing
belonging
requires
that
all
groups
and
individuals
can
contribute
to
and
impact
the
community
to
which
they
seek
to
belong
their
contributions
and
impact
may
entail
profound
transformation
of
the
community
itself
beyond
the
mere
inclusion
of
individuals
within
them.</span></p
