the
james

professor

several
colleagues
founded

way

partnerships
on

with

today
collaborations
across

are
backed

the
idea
was
if
you
think
of
all
the
cutting
edge
research
going
on
in
all
these
departments
and
you
could
connect
them
at
the
intersections
could
you
create
new
research
fields
macmillan
said
in
his
opening
remarks
at
this
years
event
held
at
the
end
of
the
academic
year
in
frick
laboratory
and
could
you
do
that
not
just
once
but
as
routine
mechanism
thats
what
we
call
that
why
were
here
today.</span></span></span></span></p
faculty
presenters
laid
out
their
work
in
four
sessions
with
topics
ranging
from
quantum
engineering
to
human
centered
decarbonization
strategies
to
the
regulation
of
microbial
proteins
across
the
day
night
cycle
afterwards
they
fielded
questions
from
peers
and
representatives
of
pcis
six
industry
partners.</span></span></span></p
the
research
is
always
so
nascent
so
cutting
edge
and
they
link
it
in
such
way
that
you
can
make
the
next
jump

youre
listening
to
fascinating
researchers
all
day
she
said
when
they
jump
from
topic
to
topic
and
they
riff
on
each
other
you
get
all
of
these
ideas
put
them
together
and
that
when
you
get
the
lightbulbs.</span></span></span></p
