jul
two
of
those
cities,&nbsp;<a
href="https://pingeorgia.org
all_projects
columbus
consolidated
govt/">columbus</a
and
georgia
received
the
awards
for
projects
that
involve
digital
twins
but
what
exactly
is
digital
twin
and
how
can
the
technology
be
used
to
solve
community
problems?&nbsp;</p
we
talked
with&nbsp;<a

directory
person
john
taylor">john
taylor</a
the
frederick
law
olmsted
professor
and
associate
chair

in

city

techs

lab
to
get
some
answers
these
are
edited
highlights
from
an
interview
nbsp;</p
what
is
digital
twin?&nbsp;</p
taylor
digital
twin
is
an
intelligent
adaptive
system
that
pairs
virtual
and
physical
worlds
in
community
development
work
smart
city
digital
twin
scdt
like
those
used
in
warner
robins
and
columbus
pairs
real
city
to
its
digital
counterpart
to
generate
data
driven
feedback
loops
of
interactions
between
cities
three
main
components
human
systems
which
includes
government
industry
and
residents
infrastructure
systems
which
are
physical
systems
and
the
services
they
provide
and
technology
systems
such
as
devices
sensors
and
data
analytics
infrastructure.&nbsp;</p
they
ve
been
used
in
manufacturing
for
some
time
how
is
that
different
from
scdt?</p
taylor
they
're
somewhat
easier
to
implement
in
manufacturing
context
because
everything
's
under
control
under
roof
they
model
all
the
different
manufacturing
machinery
and
they
use
that
to
see
when
part
might
need
to
be
changed
and
when
they
need
to
do
maintenance
and
they
can
play
with
the
system
using
real
time
running
data
to
see
what
happens
if
this
piece
does
wear
out
how
bad
would
it
be
they
could
either
adjust
that
piece
or
adjust
that
machine
or
maintain
it
whatever
it
might
be
based
on
the
scenario
analysis.&nbsp;</p
how
does
that
translate
to
the
less
controlled
environment
of
city?&nbsp;</p
taylor
it
involves
replicating
multiple
systems
for
example
if
tall
building
is
on
fire
there
will
be
multiple
systems
brought
into
play
first
you
can
see
what
's
happening
in
the
city
at
basic
level
you
can
see
that
there
's
traffic
building
up
for
example
the
next
level
is
why
is
it
happening
and
that
's
where
it
gets
little
bit
more
interesting
most
of
the
digital
twin
work
that
we
've
seen
that
anyone
's
doing
out
in
the
world
is
to
understand
why
things
are
happening
the
way
they
're
happening
but
really
the
value
starts
to
unlock
the
third
and
fourth
levels.&nbsp;</p
the
third
level
is
the
what
if
scenario
in
the
context
of
city
for
example
in
midtown
they
've
just
installed
new
traffic
signals
hopefully
someone
tested
that
out
in
advance
but
one
what
if
analysis
could
be
we
've
got
bad
traffic
in
midtown
what
if
we
put
these
traffic
signals
in
the
tech
square
area
what
effect
will
that
have
on
the
flows
in
the
city
with
digital
twin
you
can
know
that
before
you
install
the
lights
that
is
one
of
the
big
opportunities.&nbsp;</p
the
fourth
level
is
the
idea
that
the
infrastructure
could
start
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
the
citizens
and
so
in
the
example
of
the
tall
building
fire
the
traffic
signals
might
preemptively
allow
the
fire
trucks
through
but
they
could
also
do
other
things
like
make
all
of
the
signals
around
the
building
red
so
no
traffic
is
moving
and
there
's
more
space
for
people
to
evacuate
the
building
that
would
be
something
we
might
allow
the
systems
to
do
for
us.&nbsp;</p
how
is
that
different
from
for
example
project
in
valdosta
that
allows
first
responder
vehicles
to
change
the
traffic
lights
so
they
can
get
to
an
emergency
more
quickly?&nbsp;</p
mohammadi
digital
twin
will
update
itself
based
on
data
that
keeps
coming
in
if
you
think
about
the
interaction
with
the
traffic
signal
it
does
n't
care
about
what
happened
five
minutes
ago
minutes
ago
at
that
moment
they
know
that
the
driver
probably
has
better
situational
awareness
than
the
automated
system
so
they
let
the
driver
interfere
and
put
useful
inputs
into
the
systems
to
make
better
decision.&nbsp;</p
the
digital
twin
is
accumulating
data
as
it
comes
because
it
is
based
on
prediction
the
definition
of
prediction
is
looking
at
past
data
and
based
on
past
experience
predicting
what
's
likely
to
happen
in
the
future
we
know
that
time
is
moving
target
as
we
move
on
things
that
happened
in
the
past
accumulate
there
are
more
things
that
we
know
digital
twin
is
really
at
the
edge
of
this
moving
target.&nbsp;</p
tell
us
about
the
river
safety
project
in
columbus
which
uses
digital
twin
to
create
an
alert
system
to
prevent
drownings
in
the
chattahoochee
river
the
city&nbsp;was
recently
named

safety
digital
twin</a
project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p
taylor
good
project
from
our
perspective
involves
complicated
enough
scenario
where
multiple
sensors
are
involved
with
the
river
safety
project
we
had
to
understand
and
predict
water
levels
with
water
level
sensor
we
use
visual
sensing
to
understand
if
people
were
in
the
environment
when
hazardous
conditions
might
begin
to
occur
whether
we
could
get
them
out
of
harm
's
way
before
they
get
swept
away
into
the
water.&nbsp;</p
we
had
to
build
digital
twin
of
the
entire
river
basin
so
we
would
know
just
what
the
danger
is
if
the
water
level
rises
this
much
are
the
islands
that
people
are
standing
on
before
the
water
level
rises
going
to
vanish?&nbsp;</p
that
one
was
particularly
interesting
to
us
if
you
look
at
the
smart
city
digital
twin
work
we
did
first
it
was
related
to
energy
consumption
we
're
increasingly
excited
about
having
more
direct
effect
on
people
's
lives
this
one
is
stopping
people
from
drowning.&nbsp;</p
tell
us
about
the
digital
twin
you
developed

taylor
this
project
is
pretty
complicated
from
our
perspective
because
we
had
to
build
geographic
information
systems
gis
map
of
the
city
we
also
have
to
know
where
crimes
have
been
occurring
we
've
got
more
than
years
of
crime
data
including
very
recent
crime
data
we
're
deploying
sensors
in
part
to
deter
crimes
but
also
to
detect
and
collect
more
information
about
crime
patterns
it
comes
down
to
taking
the
information
about
where
crimes
are
occurring
and
coupling
that
with
predictions
about
routes
people
would
take
if
they
did
commit
crime
so
that
the
car
would
come
into
view
of
one
of
the
cameras
we
do
n't
hide
the
camera
we
put
it
on
very
visible
structure
where
we
predict
most
likely
the
crimes
are
going
to
occur
this
week
we
put
this
very
visible
thing
to
discourage
people
from
doing
anything
once
they
realize
they
're
being
watched
and
we
found
that
it
did
in
fact
reduce
crimes
in
those
high
crime
spots
by
20%.</p
what
are
some
other
ways
communities
can
use
digital
twins?&nbsp;</p
taylor
we
published
something
this
spring
and
we
're
working
on
funding
proposal
now
about
how
ambulances
move
around
during
period
of
inundation
coastal
flooding
coastal
inundation
or
heavy
rains
we
ve
met
with
charleston
south
carolina
and
savannah
about
this
we
looked
at
data
in
virginia
beach
to
see
if
in
real
time
as
the
flooding
is
changing
we
could
deploy
ambulances
in
different
parts
of
the
city
ahead
of
where
they
're
needed
its
ambulance
routing
during
natural
disaster
event.</p
are
there
limitations
to
smart
city
digital
twin
technology?</p
taylor
when
we
travel
around
and
we
present
this
some
clever
student
or
faculty
member
will
say
would
n't
great
research
project
be
to
figure
out
how
to
build
central
platform
for
the
collection
of
this
data
or
standard
format
for
the
way
this
data
should
be
sent
so
that
all
the
systems
can
talk
to
each
other
and
they
re
right
it
's
difficult
to
get
the
value
across
whole
city
if
you
're
only
looking
at
one
system
at
time
future
research
topic
is
figuring
out
those
data
flows
and
the
centralization
of
that
data.&nbsp;</p
