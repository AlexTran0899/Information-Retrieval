dark
matter
is
one
of
the
biggest
mysteries
in
physics
and
cosmology
though
it
ca
n't
be
seen
directly
scientists
suspect
its
what
holds
galaxies
together
and
makes
up
about
of
all
mass
in
the
universe.</p
global
team
of
over
scientists
and
engineers
from
institutions
led
by
lawrence
berkeley
national
laboratory
and
including
students
postdoctoral
researchers
and
faculty
from
brown
university
are
to
understand
the
true
nature
of
dark
matter
and
catch
glimpse
of
this
elusive
substance
for
the
first
time
they
use
highly
sensitive
detector
to
look
for
tiny
flashes
of
light
that
might
occur
when
dark
matter
particles
interact
with
atoms
in
the
detector
while
they
do
nt
reveal
the
existence
of
dark
matter
their
latest
results
show
that
the
team
has
been
getting
closer
than
any
team
of
scientists
to

presented
on
monday
aug.
at
conferences
in
chicago
and
so
paulo
brazil
the
new
results
offer
important
insights
into
wimps
which
are
the
leading
theoretical
candidates
for
comprising
dark
matter
short
for
weakly
interacting
massive
particles
wimps
ca
nt
be
seen
because
they
do
nt
absorb
emit
or
reflect
light
and
they
interact
with
normal
matter
only
on
rare
occasions
which
is
why
they
re
so
hard
to
detect
even
when
millions
may
be
traveling
through
the
earth
and
everything
on
it
each
second.</p
after
analyzing
nearly
days
of
data
from
the
lux
zeplin
lz
dark
matter
detector
researchers
have
refined
their
search
for
these
elusive
particles
exploring
weaker
dark
matter
interactions
than
ever
explored
before
the
key
finding
is
that
the
team
came
up
with
no
evidence
for
wimp
signals
above
mass
of
9gigaelectronvolts
c2
measurement
roughly
equivalent
to
nine
times
the
weight
of
proton
it
suggests
wimps
are
interacting
with
matter
at
weaker
levels
than
previously
thought.</p
our
goal
is
to
improve
our
search
even
further
with
an
even
better
level
of
sensitivity

the
findings

represent

gaitskell
added
they
help
researchers
narrow
their
search
improving
their
understanding
of
dark
matter
if
it
exists
for
instance
the
experiments
ability
to
detect
extremely
faint
interactions
now
allows
researchers
to
rule
out
many
possible
dark
matter
models
that
predict
interactions
stronger
than
what
the
data
shows
ultimately
dwindling
down
the
options
for
where
wimps
could
be
hiding.</p
our
new
tonne
lz
detector
is
more
massive
and
more
sensitive
than
any
previous
direct
search
experiment
gaitskell
said
we
are
potentially
able
to
see
things
that
no
one
has
seen
before.</p
zeroing
in
on
dark
matter</strong></h3
the
lz
detector
is
located
mile
below
the
black
hills
of
south
dakota
in
the
sanford
underground
research
facility
the
descent
into
the
former
gold
mine
which
was
also
home
to
the
precursor
lux
experiment
until
takes
about
minutes
via
elevator
the
heart
of
the
lz
consists
of
two
nested
titanium
tanks
filled
with
about
tons
of
pure
liquid
xenon
the
tanks
are
monitored
by
photomultiplier
tubes
pmts
that
will
detect
the
dark
matter
particles
if
they
re
there.</p
the
theory
for
this
detection
works
like
this
if
wimps
are
present
they
may
occasionally
collide
with
the
nucleus
of
xenon
atom
causing
tiny
flash
of
light
and
some
movement
in
the
atoms
if
that
happens
the
pmts
are
meant
to
catch
that
interaction
capturing
that
glimpse
of
course
is
exceedingly
difficult
and
why
most
researchers
instead
infer
things
about
dark
matter
through
how
its
powerful
gravity
bends
and
focuses
the
light
around
it
phenomenon
called
gravitational
lensing.</p

team
plans
to
gather
over
1,000
days
of
data.</p
this
is
how
science
works
gaitskell
said
this
is
huge
question
we
are
trying
to
answer
what
is
most
of
the
matter
in
the
universe
made
of
it
wo
nt
get
answered
in
matter
of
weeks
months
or
even
years
necessarily
this
is
one
that
will
take
decades
to
answer
and
that
is
actually
pretty
typical
of
most
major
scientific
questions
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
history
books
you
'll
realize
that
major
discoveries
are
separated
by
long
periods
of
time
and
happened
step
by
step.</p
this
new
results
marks
the
first
time
that
lz
has
applied
salting
technique
that
adds
fake
wimp
signals
during
data
collection
by
camouflaging
the
real
data
until
unsalting
at
the
very
end
researchers
can
avoid
unconscious
bias
and
keep
from
overly
interpreting
or
changing
their
analysis
before
knowing
the
outcome.</p
theres
human
tendency
to
want
to
see
patterns
in
data
so
its
really
important
when
you
enter
this
new
regime
that
no
bias
wanders
in
said
scott
haselschwardt
the
lz
physics
coordinator
and
an
assistant
professor
at

university
of

if
you
make
discovery
you
want
to
get
it
right.</p

once

's

it
's
very
special
experience
getting

ding
said
it
's
not
just
going

you
still
need
