notre

director
of
staff
sat
down
with
dennis
brown
assistant
vice
president
for
to
discuss
his
lifes
journey
and
the
initiatives
he
led
on
campus.</p
lets
start
with
little
of
your
background
where
you
grew
up
and
your
educational
and
career
paths.</h2
do
diversity
work
because
think
inherently
made
to
do
this
type
of
work
come
from
very
diverse
background
my
father
was
african
american
he
passed
away
six
years
ago
an
african
american
from
osceola
arkansas
my
mother
is
white
and
she
from
liverpool
england
grew
up
in
england
and
idaho
on
my
mothers
side
my
grandfather
was
catholic
my
grandmother
was
jewish
they
raised
their
children
my
mom
and
her
siblings
not
catholic
or
jewish
but
church
of
england
protestant
couple
of
my
older
siblings
were
baptized
church
of
england
protestant
my
mom
married
baptist
from
the
south
we
kind
of
were
considered
church
of
england
protestant
growing
up
until
we
moved
to
idaho
then
think
episcopalian
was
the
closest
thing
here
at
notre
dame
go
to
mass
and
one
of
my
favorite
things
to
do
is
to
walk
up
cross
my
arms
and
get
blessing.</p
what
about
your
undergraduate
and
graduate
education?</h2
attended
boise
state
with
degree
in
social
sciences
with
an
emphasis
on
political
science
and
psychology
got
my
masters
at
idaho
state
in
counseling
at
idaho
state
wrote
proposal
to
the
president
of
the
university
suggesting
that
he
hire
me
as
grad
assistant
to
work
on
issues
of
diversity
was
his
intern
for
one
year
after
that
they
opened
it
up
and
created
the
presidents
fellowship
think
the
next
year
they
had
one
the
following
year
they
had
two
believe
it
continues
now
they
have
about
grad
students
pick
project
that
they
want
to
work
on
and
its
funded
and
they
report
to
the
president
that
was
long
standing
tradition
that
started.</p
after
your
masters
what
next?</h2
worked
on
my
masters
for
two
years
when
completed
that
then
idaho
state
hired
me
so
worked
there
an
additional
five
years
guess
that
really
where
honed
my
skills
on
diversity
and
inclusion
then
decided
to
work
on
doctoral
degree
and
went
to
iu
and
worked
on
it
for
few
years
was
getting
burnt
out
on
school
so
applied
for
job
as
director
of
diversity
education
and
got
it
still
dabbled
on
my
ph.d.
little
bit
but
still
have
nt
finished
just
love
diversity
work
as
said
think
inherently
made
for
it
but
think
its
important
work
feel
like
can
really
make
difference.</p
youve
been
at
notre
dame
now
for
just
over
seven
years
and
have
trained
several
thousand
staff
members
tell
us
about
the
work
you
ve
been
doing.</h2
offer
three
workshops
one
of
them
is
about
minutes
its
part
of
full
day
of
onboarding.</p
for
new
employees?</h2
all
new
employees
go
through
onboarding
they
learn
about
benefits
they
learn
about
the
university
do
minute
workshop
that
helps
lay
the
foundation
of
how
were
expected
to
treat
each
other
with
dignity
and
respect
then
the
two
other
workshops
are
very
similar
one
of
them
is
called
multicultural
competencies
hiring
game
changers
that
full
day
workshop
part
of
the
afternoon
is
dedicated
to
hiring
managers
and
supervisors
helping
them
take
the
bias
out
of
job
descriptions
out
of
announcements
and
advertising
and
interviewing
and
ultimately
hiring
that
workshop
specifically
for
hiring
managers
and
supervisors.</p
then
the
rest
of
it
deals
with
benefits
of
diversity
defining
some
terminology
multicultural
competency
we
learn
how
we
gain
skills
and
attributes
that
help
us
treat
everyone
no
matter
who
comes
into
our
office
no
matter
who
we
work
with
we
treat
everybody
with
dignity
and
respect
make
sure
we
give
everybody
the
same
level
of
service
whether
they
re
muslim
woman
in
hijab
or
they
re
an
african
american
male
in
hoodie
or
an
older
person
with
walker
that
taking
while
to
get
up
to
our
desk
whoever
it
is
we
treat
them
all
with
the
same
basic
excellent
service
that
expected
with
notre
dame.</p
thats
multicultural
competencies
it
helps
us
learn
little
bit
about
different
cultures
so
were
not
surprised
when
somebody
comes
in
even
if
were
comfortable
we
do
nt
have
any
ill
will
but
were
surprised
if
oh
there
somebody
wearing
something
different
that
person
might
pick
up
on
it
and
then
they
might
interpret
that
as
negative
thing
multicultural
competencies
help
us
make
sure
we
serve
different
populations
with
the
same
level
of
service.</p
we
also
have
workshop
on
microaggressions
to
help
notre
dame
staff
treat
each
other
well
so
were
comfortable
we
can
do
our
best
work
and
we
can
continue
to
excel
as
university
hired
eve
kelly
diversity
and
inclusion
program
manager
she
helps
with
all
the
programs
we
initiated
in
designing
our
path
forward
for
staff
at
notre
dame
regarding
looking
at
analytics
and
more
campus
outreach.</p
what
about
some
of
the
guest
speakers
who
know
you
bring
in
for
these
workshops?</h2
as
part
of
the
multicultural
competencies
workshop
usually
bring
in
cultural
speaker
we
ve
had
people
who
do
research
on
diversity
in
higher
education
people
who
do
research
in
corporate
we
have
an
ongoing
person
bring
in
who
from
the
pokagon
band
of
the
potawatomi
that
talks
about
issues
locally
and
general
issues
about
native
americans
ve
had
someone
from
the
latino
community
that
talks
about
immigration
and
those
issues
ve
had
speaker
talk
about
lgbtq+
identities
we
rotate
speakers
the
most
frequent
one
is
puerto
rican
doctoral
candidate
who
lives
in
bloomington
and
he
does
theater
work
on
race
and
inclusion
what
about
for
employees
who
are
nt
supervisors
or
hiring
managers
tell
me
about
the
training
for
them.</h2
we
have
we
are
all
nd
we
all
know
the
phrase
we
are
nd
this
just
tweaks
it
little
bit
to
let
you
know
that
no
matter
who
you
are
where
you
re
from
your
gender
your
job
title
your
socioeconomic
status
religion
we
are
all
nd
if
you
re
here
you
re
part
of
the
notre
dame
family
that
four
hour
workshop
that
covers
similar
material
as
the
other
workshop
without
the
cultural
speaker
and
without
the
hiring
game
changers
its
definitions
its
multicultural
competency
microaggressions
and
we
have
small
group
dialogue
where
people
just
get
chance
to
share
their
experiences
that
required
for
all
staff
who
are
nt
supervisors
supervisors
managers
take
the
other
class
for
full
day
all
other
employees
are
required
to
take
the
four
hour
workshop.</p
do
you
offer
some
optional
programming?</h2
yes
we
also
periodically
bring
in
guest
speakers
we
also
offer
some
other
workshops
such
as
hanukkah
and
kwanzaa
program
around
the
holidays
we
celebrate
christmas
extensively
here
which
as
we
should
decembers
my
favorite
month
at
notre
dame
its
amazing
do
hanukkah
kwanzaa
program
hanukkah
is
jewish
holiday
kwanzaa
is
an
african
american
holiday
we
do
both
of
them
just
little
program
give
information
have
some
food
its
been
really
well
received
these
are
cultural
opportunities
there
some
political
civil
political
dialogue
as
well
we
ve
had
one
on
racial
battle
fatigue
that
explains
the
phenomenon
of
the
stressors
that
could
take
place
from
people
of
color
in
majority
of
white
spaces
or
women
in
majority
male
spaces
anything
that
we
can
enlighten
people
on
so
we
can
become
more
empathetic
or
sympathetic
with
our
colleagues
all
of
these
workshops
are
all
tied
together
to
increase
peoples
comfortability
in
having
dialogue
talking
about
these
issues
not
being
afraid
to
ask
about
it.</p
we
focus
on
inclusion
we
focus
on
catholic
social
teaching
we
focus
on
really
aligning
our
diversity
and
inclusion
initiatives
with
our
catholic
social
teaching
and
the
notre
dame
mission
if
we
want
to
be
force
for
good
in
the
world
we
have
to
know
the
world
so
were
learning
more
about
it
everything
we
do
it
has
an
eye
to
our
catholic
social
teaching
and
the
mission
of
notre
dame.</p
can
you
speak
to
how
these
sessions
are
not
about
political
correctness
but
instead
are
in
harmony
with
catholic
social
Teaching?</h2
think
one
major
premise
of
catholic
social
teaching
and
think
other
areas
of
the
catholic
faith
is
that
we
are
all
made
in
the
image
of
god
how
can
we
mistreat
someone
who
made
in
the
image
of
god
whether
you
disagree
with
someone
or
you
do
nt
understand
somebody
you
still
have
to
treat
every
individual
with
basic
human
dignity
and
respect
we
also
have
the
spirit
of
inclusion
at
notre
dame
which
goes
well
beyond
our
workshops
what
were
doing
is
right
in
line
with
other
notre
dame
initiatives.</p
do
you
have
basic
philosophy
behind
your
work?</h2
one
of
the
opening
statements
make
for
all
the
workshops
that
ve
done
ve
done
hundreds
of
workshops
trained
over
5,000
notre
dame
staff
always
say
that
we
do
nt
all
have
to
agree
were
different
look
around
the
room
there
no
one
person
who
exactly
the
same
as
anybody
else
its
ok
to
disagree
we
think
differently
we
come
from
different
backgrounds
were
supposed
to
disagree
but
when
we
do
we
have
to
do
it
with
dignity
and
respect
feel
my
ultimate
goal
in
my
role
at
notre
dame
with
my
strategic
plans
with
all
the
work
that
do
is
to
help
create
campus
climate
that
conducive
for
everyone
to
do
their
best
work
no
matter
where
they
re
from
who
they
are
if
they
have
an
accent
their
job
title
their
religion
their
race
their
gender
their
ethnicity
whoever
they
are
if
they
re
here
they
re
part
of
the
notre
dame
family
they
should
be
treated
with
dignity
and
respect.</p
do
you
have
any
favorite
moments
of
your
time
here?</h2
one
thing
really
love
about
notre
dame
is
our
staff
chaplains
and
father
jim
bracke
in
particular
mentioned
that
my
father
passed
away
when
first
moved
here
my
father
had
cancer
and
someone
told
father
bracke
he
checked
in
with
me
weekly
every
week
to
see
how
my
dad
was
doing
to
see
how
my
mom
was
holding
up
when
my
father
was
on
his
deathbed
essentially
father
bracke
called
he
did
nondenominational
prayer
but
then
he
also
did
catholic
blessing
for
my
dad
he
passed
away
maybe
two
days
later
my
mom
talks
about
that
still
that
notre
dame
that
kind
of
love
and
caring
and
compassion
father
bracke
does
that
for
so
many
people
do
nt
know
how
he
does
it
he
absolutely
amazing
that
one
of
my
favorite
moments
at
notre
dame
do
nt
think
you
can
be
on
this
campus
without
having
some
sort
of
spiritual
feeling
its
just
part
of
the
place.</p
another
special
memory
is
when
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
vice
president
for
took
me
to
father
teds
office
in
the
library
was
in
awe
after
hearing
him
tell
stories
of
civil
rights
battles
and
triumphs
for
about
minutes
he
turned
to
me
and
said
we
ve
been
talking
about
diversity
for
long
time
and
now
we
need
you
to
do
something
let
me
know
how
can
help
when
you
get
your
marching
orders
from
father
ted
you
get
to
work.</p
as
we
pay
tribute
this
week
to
martin
luther
king
jr.
know
you
ve
played
role
in
expanding
observations
nationwide
can
you
talk
about
that?</h2
was
instrumental
as
an
undergrad
in
having
idaho
adopt
the
martin
luther
king
holiday
as
legal
in
idaho
idaho
was
one
of
four
states
that
did
nt
have
legal
state
holiday
as
an
undergrad
started
to
push
for
us
to
have
that
organized
marches
and
rallies
and
ultimately
we
got
holiday
the
governor
when
he
signed
it
into
law
he
said
there
were
lot
of
people
who
were
involved
several
senators
the
human
rights
commission
but
there
one
person
that
without
him
it
would
nt
have
happened
and
he
called
me
by
name
and
gave
me
the
pen
he
used
to
sign
the
legislation
since
then
ve
been
involved
in
martin
luther
king
events
all
over
the
country
for
years
boise
state
still
does
an
event
that
started
they
do
march
every
year
idaho
state
still
does
events
that
started
indiana
university
does
events
that
we
started
our
prayer
vigil
here
at
notre
dame
is
one
of
the
things
that
ve
helped
initiate
here
four
campuses
doing
king
events.</p
the
prayer
vigil
the
night
before
mlk
day
has
become
popular
event
on
campus
tell
us
about
your
role
in
that.</h2
the
first
time
we
did
the
midnight
prayer
vigil
was
speaking
at
the
king
holiday
in
idaho
flew
back
sunday
evening
and
then
was
going
to
be
the
first
speaker
sunday
night
father
john
and
were
on
the
docket
remember
it
was
negative
degrees
but
it
was
so
beautiful
arrived
at
like
11:30
and
there
was
father
john
knew
he
was
going
to
be
there
because
he
was
speaking
but
then
there
was
john
affleck
graves
and
bob
mcquade
paul
browne
all
these
senior
level
vice
presidents
ve
been
at
all
these
different
universities
and
that
is
nt
always
the
case
for
me
to
arrive
at
11:30
at
night
for
midnight
program
negative
degrees
and
all
these
senior
level
people
are
there
got
emotional
when
notre
dame
does
something
they
mean
it
look
at
everybody
that
here
then
the
students
were
there
got
emotional
because
thought
this
is
such
special
place
again
the
prayer
vigils
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
ve
ever
seen.</p
overall
how
do
you
think
your
work
here
has
been
received?</h2
think
my
work
has
been
really
well
received
at
notre
dame
if
we
look
at
the
evaluations
of
the
5,000
people
that
have
taken
training
there
are
very
few
people
who
have
been
dissatisfied
and
most
of
them
it
was
nt
because
they
did
nt
like
the
workshop
it
had
to
do
with
dreading
to
come
to
it
but
those
people
tell
me
afterwards
that
they
did
nt
want
to
come
but
then
we
make
it
so
comfortable
to
talk
about
these
issues
and
that
the
time
flew
by
get
that
more
than
anything
enjoying
the
challenges
that
we
have
at
notre
dame
in
many
ways
were
much
more
compassionate
get
lot
of
support
from
bob
mcquade
my
boss
from
the
executive
vice
presidents
office
the
presidents
leadership
council
we
have
lot
of
support
but
we
still
have
lot
of
work
to
do
too.</p
we
do
as
society.</h2
absolutely.</p
