the
boston
massacre
trial
re
enactment</span
when
regiment
of
british
soldiers
was
accused
of
murdering
five
colonists
in
the
boston
massacre
of
the
attorneys
who
saved
the
soldiers&rsquo
lives
at
trial
were
staunch
american
patriots.</p
it
was
not
an
easy
decision
to
advocate
for
the
enemy.</p></blockquote
josiah
quincy
jr.&rsquo;s
father
wrote
in
letter
few
weeks
after
the
massacre
ldquo;i
am
under
great
affliction
at
hearing
the
bitterest
reproaches
uttered
against
you
for
having
become
an
advocate
for
those
criminals
who
are
charged
with
the
murder
of
their
fellow
citizens
good
god
is
it
possible?&rdquo;</p
today
historians
see
the
trial
as
an
early
test
of
the
colonies&rsquo
legal
system
laying
the
foundation
for
the
united
states
as
nation
ruled
by
laws
rather
than
the
arbitrary
decisions
of
people
in
power.</p></blockquote
quincy
replied
that
he
was
convinced
to
defend
the
british
by
no
less
than
his
co
counsel
john
adams
founding
father
and
future
president
of
the
new
nation
adams
worried
that
an
unfair
trial
would
do
serious
long
term
damage
to
the
patriots&rsquo
cause
he
later
wrote
that
defending
the
soldiers
was
ldquo;one
of
the
best
pieces
of
service
ever
rendered
my
country.&rdquo;</p
ironically
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
that
trial
charged
with
finding
the
british
soldiers
guilty
was
british
official
and
loyalist
to
the
king
today

on
thursday
notre

law
student
nico

dressed
in

costume
at
boston&rsquo;s
old
south
meeting
house
and
thundered
about
the
rule
of
law
in
his
role
as
john

howard
delivered
his
argument
in
mock
trial
competition
with
stephen
labrecque
boston
college
law
student
and

graduate
in
modern
reinterpretation
of

closing
arguments
the

sponsored
thursday&rsquo;s
event
as
part
of
the
university&rsquo;s
annual
shamrock
series
the
weekend
culminates
with
saturday&rsquo;s
football
game
against
boston
college
at
fenway
park
but
it
also
includes
events
meant
to
bring
the
notre

experience
on
the
road
including
academic
presentations
service
projects
concerts
and
masses.</p
jack

u.s.

the
northern

of
illinois
presided
over
the

attended
by

reception
afterwards
was
held
at
the
old

house

out

indicates
the
site
of
the
massacre.</p
blakey
graduate
of
notre
dame
and
notre
dame
law
school
declined
to
pick
winner
ldquo;because
the
rule
of
law
continues
to
this
day.&rdquo
but
he
said
the
triumph
of
law
over
arbitrary
power
is
something
that
should
be
cherished
and
that
citizens
must
earn
through
participation
in
our
democracy.</p
student
wearing
powdered
wig
and
period
clothing
speaking
at
podium
notre
dame
law
professor
introduced
the
re
enactment
with
presentation
on
the
history
and
context
of
the
boston
massacre
and
trial.</p
the
incident
started
with
misunderstanding
over
man&rsquo;s
honor
wigmaker&rsquo;s
apprentice
accused
british
officer
of
not
paying
his
bill
taunting
sentry
outside
the
customs
house
on
what
is
now
known
as
state
street
it
was
later
discovered
that
the
bill
had
been
settled
the
previous
day
the
sentry
responded
by
striking
the
young
man
with
his
musket
drawing
crowd
of
other
colonists
to
the
scene.</p
bellia
said
colonial
resentment
of
british
presence
had
been
growing
in
boston
since
the
soldiers
were
stationed
there
two
years
earlier
to
enforce
the
townshend
acts
which
included
revenue
taxes
on
items
such
as
wine
paper
and
glass.</p
at
first
no
one
wanted
to
represent
the
soldiers
bellia
said
until
john
adams
risked
his
law
practice
for
his
belief
that
everyone
deserves
fair
trial.</p></blockquote
more
british
soldiers
arrived
at
the
scene
to
protect
the
sentry
and
the
crowd
attacked
the
regiment
with
snowballs
rocks
and
coal
there
are
conflicting
accounts
of
how
the
firing
started
but
five
colonists
ended
up
dead
including
crispus
attucks
an
african
american
british
gov.
thomas
hutchinson
finally
dispersed
the
crowd
by
promising
full
inquiry
into
the
incident.</p
at
first
no
one
wanted
to
represent
the
soldiers
bellia
said
until
john
adams
risked
his
law
practice
for
his
belief
that
everyone
deserves
fair
trial
the
jury
was
asked
to
determine
if
the
soldiers
fired
in
self
defense
the
regiment&rsquo;s
captain
and
six
others
were
acquitted
and
two
soldiers
were
found
guilty
of
manslaughter
their
lives
were
spared
but
an
ldquo;m&rdquo
was
branded
on
their
thumbs
mdash
bellia
joked
that
this
part
would
not
be
re
enacted
in
the
interest
of
saving
time.</p

six
years
later
paul
revere
produced
an
inaccurate
engraving
of
the
scene
that
circulated
widely
as
anti
british
propaganda
john
adams&rsquo
cousin
samuel
adams
wrote
critically
of
the
soldiers
and
organized
annual
commemorations
of
the
event
to
whip
up
resentment
of
king
george
iii
and
british
rule
the
boston
massacre
is
considered
the
first
match
that
later
exploded
into
the
american
revolution.</p
yet
john
adams
saw
the
trial
as
an
important
test
of
the
rule
of
law
ldquo;even
in
politically
volatile
situation
the
law
still
prevailed,&rdquo
bellia
said
in
contrast
the
aristocracy
in
many
european
societies
at
that
time
could
easily
use
their
power
to
subvert
the
law.</p
bellia
said
unique
aspect
of
notre
dame&rsquo;s
law
school
is
its
focus
on
constitutional
structure
mdash
the
role
power
and
limits
of
government
mdash
to
ensure
that
laws
are
enforced
in
practice.</p
