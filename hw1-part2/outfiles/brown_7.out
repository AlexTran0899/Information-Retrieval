brown

scientists
with
the
research
consortium
have
developed
brain
computer
interface
that
translates
brain
signals
into
speech
with
up
to
accuracy
offering
significant
breakthrough
for
individuals
with
speech
impairments
due
to
conditions
like
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis.</p
the
technology
involves
using
implanted
sensors
in
the
brain
to
interpret
brain
signals
when
user
attempts
to
speak
these
signals
are
then
converted
into
text
which
is
read
aloud
by
computer.</p
the
work
is
described
in
new
study
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
published
on
wednesday
aug.
that
was
led
by

david
brandman
and
neuroscientist
sergey
stavisky
both
of
whom
are
brown
university
alumni
and
faculty
members
at

our
bci
technology
helped
man
with
paralysis
to
communicate
with
friends
families
and
caregivers
brandman
said
our
paper
demonstrates
the
most
accurate
speech

ever
reported.</p

effectively
within

the
powerful
moment
brought
tears
to
harrell
and
his

harrell
reflecting
on
his
experience
with
the
technology
described
the
impact
that
regaining
the
ability
to
communicate
could
have
on
others
facing
similar
challenges.</p
not
being
able
to
communicate
is
so
frustrating
and
demoralizing
it
is
like
you
are
trapped
harrell
said
something
like
this
technology
will
help
people
back
into
life
and
society.</p
the
first
time
harrell
tried
the
system
he

was

who

casey
and
our
other
braingate
participants
are
truly
extraordinary
hochberg
said
they
deserve
tremendous
credit
for
joining
these
early
clinical
trials
they
do
this
not
because
they
re
hoping
to
gain
any
personal
benefit
but
to
help
us
develop
system
that
will
restore
communication
and
mobility
for
other
people
with

it
is
the
latest
in
in
brain
computer
interfaces
made
by
the
braingate
consortium
which
along
with
other
work
using

been
developing

this

in

the

at

health
implanted
the
bci
device
consisting
of
four
microelectrode
arrays
into
harrells
left
precentral
gyrus
brain
region
responsible
for
coordinating
speech
these
arrays
record
brain
activity
from
cortical
electrodes
and
detect
their
attempt
to
move
their
muscles
and
talk.</p
we
are
recording
from
the
part
of
the
brain
that
trying
to
send
these
commands
to
the
muscles
stavisky
said
we
are
basically
listening
into
that
and
were
translating
those
patterns
of
brain
activity
into
phoneme
like
syllable
or
the
unit
of
speech
and
then
the
words
they
re
trying
to
say.</p

the

in

the

the

at
