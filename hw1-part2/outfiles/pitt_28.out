many
americans
face
hurdles</strong
in
getting
health
care
but
almost
all
americans
can
easily
get
to
pharmacy.</p
thats
the
central
premise
driving
much
of
the
work
of
lucas
berenbrok
pharm
med
an
associate
professor
of
pharmacy
and
therapeutics
in
pitts
school
of
pharmacy
he
interested
in
the
ways
pharmacies
can
be
entry
points
or
delivery
centers
for
certain
aspects
of
health
care.</p
during
the
COVID-19
shutdown
in
berenbrok
began
project
to
map
the
locations
of
the
approximately
62,000
pharmacies
in
the
country
to
learn
how
pharmacies
might
be
filling
gaps
in
peoples
health
care
needs.</p
that
work
to
visualize
pharmacy
access
grew
to
be
an
especially
valuable
tool
over
the
past
year
as
many
independent
pharmacies
as
well
as
national
chains
like
rite
aid
cvs
and
walgreens
shuttered
locations
leading
to
worries
over
what
are
known
as
pharmacy
deserts
the
this
spring
as
part
of
nationwide
project
on
pharmacy
closures.</p
berenbrok
also
organized
the
inaugural
over
the
counter
hearing
aid
and
hearing
self
care
symposium
held
at
pitt
on
june
the
event
brought
together
thought
leaders
from
pharmacy
audiology
and
public
health
to
discuss
how
the
newest
class
of
hearing
aids
which
can
be
purchased
over
the
counter
otc
can
increase
patient
access
to
hearing
health
care
in
the
united
states.</p
what
ties
the
two
projects
together
is
access
berenbrok
says
pharmacies
are
in
every
neighborhood
and
they
re
open
on
nights
weekends
holidays
when
some
other
health
care
providers
might
not
be
open
and
so
people
really
look
to
pharmacies
as
place
where
they
can
get
health
care
and
they
can
help
with
their
overall
health
and
wellness.</p
we
spoke
with
berenbrok
about
his
work
the
interview
has
been
edited
for
length
and
clarity.</p
pitt

how
did
you
get
interested
in
being
pharmacist?</h2
lucas
berenbrok
liked
the
chemistry
piece
of
it
liked
the
science
behind
it
and
liked
this
idea
that
could
help
people
in
very
specific
way
grew
up
in
beaver
county
and
my
first
job
was
working
at
giant
eagle
stocking
shelves
getting
buggies
and
my
favorite
part
of
the
job
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
conveyor
belt
and
bagging
groceries
because
got
to
talk
to
people
it
made
me
feel
part
of
the
community
and
so
that
kind
of
how
and
why
gravitate
toward
community
pharmacy
because
like
being
that
staple
and
that
face
of
community.</p
when
was
in
pharmacy
school
at
pitt
was
doing
research
on
how
community
pharmacists
could
do
more
than
dispense
medication
they
could
offer
vaccinations
and
comprehensive
medication
reviews
in
went
to
the
american
pharmacists
associations
annual
meeting
to
compete
in
the
patient
counseling
competition
to
represent
pitt
on
national
stage
at
that
meeting
placed
in
the
top
it
gave
me
some
confidence
like
pretty
good
at
talking
to
patients
and
doing
the
things
that
the
community
pharmacists
do
best.</p
how
did
your
mapping
project
come
about?</h2
wanted
to
prove
this
talking
point
people
often
say
that
of
americans
live
within
five
miles
of
pharmacy
but
its
difficult
to
find
how
that
stat
came
to
be
figuring
there
gap
in
the
literature
got
together
with
some
folks
from
the
department
of
geology
and
environmental
science
here
at
pitt
they
re
the
mapping
experts
and
some
of
my
colleagues
at
the
school
of
pharmacy
we
assumed
then
that
the
COVID-19
vaccines
would
be
given
at
community
pharmacies
so
we
wrote
white
paper
that
talked
about
pharmacy
locations
when
vaccines
would
be
available
and
predicted
pharmacies
would
be
place
where
they
would
be
distributed
and
administered
that
paper
came
out
two
or
three
days
before
the
emergency
use
authorization
was
granted
for
the
pfizer
COVID-19
vaccine
it
was
very
exciting
time
to
have
that
analysis
come
out
and
then
see
people
look
to
it
for
vaccine
planning
initiatives.</p
since
then
we
ve
applied
the
mapping
to
lots
of
different
things
that
you
can
do
at
the
community
pharmacy
have
some
projects
with
students
looking
at
otc
birth
control
that
just
went
on
the
market
in
the
first
quarter
of
and
we
have
another
group
looking
at
otc
hearing
aids
were
able
to
apply
where
the
maps
are
and
to
show
that
when
things
are
available
at
community
pharmacy
people
can
access
them
better.</p
how
did
you
get
involved
with
hearing
aids?</h2
in
was
taking
our
first
year
student
pharmacists
to
senior
community
centers
to
do
what
we
call
brown
bag
review
seniors
would
bring
their
medications
in
brown
paper
bag
and
then
our
students
with
faculty
would
review
their
medications
and
help
with
any
questions
or
address
safety
and
effectiveness.</p
was
thinking
about
other
things
that
older
adults
need
help
with
and
hearing
came
to
mind
that
how
connected
with
the
audiology
folks
at
the
school
of
health
and
rehabilitation
sciences
shrs
my
long
term
collaborator
elaine
mormer
pitt
professor
of
audiology
and
the
vice
chair
for
clinical
education
communication
science
and
disorders
had
brought
her
students
to
do
hearing
screenings
elaine
looked
at
me
and
said
hey
you
know
law
was
just
signed
that
creates
new
category
of
hearing
aids
that
are
going
to
be
sold
over
the
counter.</p
no
one
in
pharmacy
was
talking
about
this
yet
but
everyone
in
audiology
was
and
now
we
ve
developed
program
to
educate
pharmacists
about
hearing
health
care
and
otc
hearing
aids
were
doing
more
research
to
find
practice
models
and
make
sure
that
pharmacists
are
engaging
with
audiologists
so
it
can
be
team
collaboration.</p
what
about
pharmacy
closures
are
you
seeing
any
patterns?</h2
over
time
we
'll
start
doing
analysis
to
look
at
trends
in
the
rate
of
closures
also
want
to
match
this
to
openings
because
the
closure
is
only
one
side
of
the
coin
if
pharmacies
are
opening
where
pharmacies
are
closing
is
there
really
problem
some
other
people
have
suggested
that
pharmacies
are
closing
in
lower
socioeconomic
areas
and
opening
in
more
affluent
communities
but
we
have
nt
done
any
of
those
analyses
yet
that
's
going
to
be
later
in
2024.</p
when
you
got
into
this
field
did
you
imagine
that
map
making
would
be
an
important
part
of
your
work?</h2
you
know
one
of
the
ways
that
pitts
school
of
pharmacy
has
been
talking
about
pharmd
especially
to
prospective
students
is
how
versatile
that
degree
can
be
not
everyone
who
graduates
from
pharmacy
school
ends
up
being
clinician
some
go
into
managed
care
some
into
consulting
some
into
the
pharmaceutical
industry
and
so
we
like
that
talking
point
because
it
opens
up
this
bigger
world
of
opportunities
for
our
graduates
whenever
have
students
who
work
with
me
on
projects
we
always
love
to
kind
of
spin
in
the
fact
that
by
doing
this
research
were
advocating
for
what
pharmacists
can
do
and
were
advocating
for
patients
by
expanding
access
and
think
that
's
fun
part
of
the
research
because
were
always
looking
for
new
ways
in
which
the
pharmacist
can
provide
or
bring
value
to
the
health
system
to
health
care.</p
what
do
you
wish
more
people
knew
about
the
role
of
pharmacists?</h2
pharmacy
is
an
untapped
resource
and
profession
were
well
trained
were
the
folks
who
get
the
most
education
on
medications
and
so
part
of
our
professional
identity
as
pharmacists
is
as
the
medication
experts
but
were
also
health
care
providers
and
clinicians
when
we
think
of
pharmacists
in
this
traditional
dispensing
role
that
very
narrow
view
of
what
pharmacists
are
doing
now.</p
since
COVID-19
there
been
huge
spotlight
on
our
profession
we
have
an
opportunity
right
now
to
capitalize
on
this
limelight
so
that
people
can
see
us
as
clinicians
and
providers
and
people
who
can
make
difference
in
public
health
and
think
our
students
are
starting
to
see
that
too
that
part
of
the
reason
they
re
attracted
to
pharmacy.</p
