key="d6j00">"It
's
challenging
to
observe
the
dynamics
in
the
rhizosphere
because
it
's
naturally
concealed
beneath
the
opaque
layers
of
soil
says
postdoctoral
scholar
reinaldo
alcalde
co
first
author
of
the
new
study
this
was
motivation
to
develop
better
methods
to
image
bacteria
in
these
regions
"</p><p
data
block
key="5kel0">Traditionally
researchers
who
want
to
study
bacterial
dynamics
have
genetically
engineered
bacteria
to
fluoresce
under
laboratory
conditions
their
artificial
green
glow
visible
with
microscope
however
not
all
microbial
species
can
be
engineered
in
this
way
another
method
to
image
bacteria
quantitative
phase
imaging
is
able
to
detect
miniscule
differences
in
transparency
without
the
use
of
fluorescence.</p><p
data
block
key="3qgou">The
new
technology
is
combination
of
these
two
techniques
into
single
optical
setup
called
cfast
complex
field
and
fluorescence
microscopy
using
the
aperture
scanning
technique
the
novel
technique
can
create
three
dimensional
images
of
microbial
communities
much
faster
and
with
less
damage
than
commercial
microscopes.</p><p

key="64pof">"Through
the
3D
camera
setup
the
two
techniques
work
simultaneously
and
seamlessly

oumeng
zhang
also
co
first
author
on
the

key="a49nh">As
the
work
is
still
proof
of
concept
the
bacterial
communities
were
imaged
outside
of

under
simplified
conditions
the
team
aims
to
continue
developing
and
improving
the
technology
to
be
able
to
precisely
image
roots

bacteria
together.</p><p

is
multidisciplinary
collaboration
that
came
out
of
curiosity

blending
two

something
useful

are
many
